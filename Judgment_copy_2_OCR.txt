ISSUES TRIED BEFORE THE COURT
I.

Prenuptial Agreement

The parties executed a Prenuptial Agreement that was entered into and executed,
one day prior to their marriage, on December 4, 2014. Neither party contested the

validity of the Prenuptial Agreement at trial and submitted that the parties Stipulated to

the validity of the Prenuptial Agreement on February 3, 2022.
From the Prenuptial Agreement, the following provisions were testified to by

Alvero and Wauters.
Alvero testified that she believes the Prenuptial Agreement allows the parties to
10

jointly own a property. Paragraph 4 of the Prenuptial Agreement states, in relevant part:

MW

JOINT PROPERTY. The parties agree and understand that nothing

12

in this Agreement shall preclude them from acquiring property

13

interests during the course of their marriage as joint tenants with

14

rights of survivorship or_as tenants in common with undivided

15

interests. Additionally, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude

16

them from making binding transfers of real or personal property to

17

the other at any time during the marriage. (Emphasis added.)

18

Alvero further testified regarding Paragraph 6 of the Prenuptial

19

Agreement. Paragraph 6 states:

20

DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE. Each party to this Agreement

21

understands that the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act and court

22

decisions provide for consideration of a prenuptial agreement by the

23

event of a dissolution.
a.

each party shall have a proportionate interest in the increase in
value (during the marriage) of the homestead real estate, that the
proportion to reflect the relative values of the contributions, both
monetary and in-kind, towards the necessary household expenses

and childcare/household duties during the course of the marriage.
All savings, investments, retirement accounts, and all property

that party who brought such property into the marriage, including

12

any appreciation, income or other increase to such property.

All joint property and account shall be divided equally.

13

Cc.

14

Wauters testified to Paragraph 1 and 6. Wauters read part of the

15

provision of Paragraph | during his testimony which is as follows:

16

SEPARATE PROPERTY. Except as otherwise provided in this

17

Agreement, the following property now owned or later acquired by

18

either party shall remain and be their separate property:

Petitioner’s Request to Sell and Divide the Marital Residence

26

Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90018 (“marital residence”). The purchase price for the

27

marital residence was $978,000. Alvero testified that Wauters paid $29,340 for deposit

STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

and $208,042 for the remaining down payment. Alvero further testified that the parties
jointly acquired a $740,000 mortgage loan from Quicken Loans LLC to guarantee the
full purchase price. The mortgage loan was and remains in both parties’ names. In
support of her testimony, Alvero offered Petitioner’s Exhibit 3- Buyer Final Closing

Statement, which was admitted into evidence during her testimony. Despite Wauters’
claim that he received over $300,000 in gift from his father, he admitted that the actual
contribution from his separate property was $237,382 as reflected in Petitioner’s Exhibit
3.
Pursuant to the Grant Deed signed on January 22, 2020, the parties acquired title
10

as follows:

Il

Mathieu Christian Yves Denis Wauters, a married man as his

12

sole and separate property, as to an undivided 65% interest and
Rosanna Claire Alvero Wauters,

a_married woman as her sole

14

and separate property, as to an undivided 35% interest, as tenants

1S

in common. (Emphasis added.)

16

17
18

The Grant Deed was offered as evidence as Petitioner’s Exhibit 4 during
Petitioner’s case in chief and has been admitted into evidence.

The owner of the legal title to property is presumed to be the owner of the full

19

beneficial title. This presumption may be rebutted only by clear and convincing proof.

20

Evidence Code § 662.

21

“According to the ‘form of title’ presumption, the description in a deed as to how

22

title is held is presumed to reflect the actual ownership interests in the property.” Carne

23

v. Worthington (2016) 246 Cal.App.4" 548, 556. “The phrase ‘clear and convincing

24

evidence’ has been defined as ‘clear, explicit, and unequivocal,’ ‘so clear as to leave no

25

substantial doubt,’ and ‘sufficiently strong to demand the unhesitating assent of every

26

reasonable mind.’” People v. Caruso (1968) 68 Cal.2d 183, 190.

27
28

STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-

6

Alvero testified that her understanding of the Grant Deed is that she would
receive 35% interest in net value of the marital residence upon division. She further
testified that Wauters interest is 65% because he was being compensated for the down

payment he contributed from his separate property.
Wauters did not provide any evidence contesting the validity of the Grant Deed or
ownership interest described within the Deed. Wauters testified that Alvero’s 35%
interest was conditioned upon her repayment to Wauter’s father a $30,000 loan. The
Deed of Trust does not reflect and there is no documentation of the loan terms or
purported conditional ownership based on repayment of the loan.
10

The Court credits Alvero’s testimony supported by Petitioner’s Exhibit 3 that Mr.

MH

Wauter’s separate property contribution towards acquisition of the marital residence was

12

$237,382. Based on the language of the Grant Deed (Petitioner’s Exhibit 4), the Court

13

credits Alvero’s testimony that Wauters received 65% interest in the home to

14

compensate him for his separate property a contribution of $237,382.

15

Division of Marital Residence and Applicability of Paragraph 6 of Prenuptial

16

Agreement

17

With respect to proportional contribution provision of Paragraph 6 of the

18

Prenuptial Agreement, Alvero testified that her understanding of this paragraph is that

19

both parties were permitted to make monetary and in-kind contributions which includes

20

payment of household expense and involvement in household duties during the

21

marriage.

22

Alvero testified that she worked between the time the property was acquired and

23

the day she moved out of the home in December and contributed to payment of the

24

mortgage and household bills by directly depositing a portion of her bi-weekly salary

25

into the joint Chase account ending in 8631. Alvero testified that she did not live in the

26

marital residence for most of October, November and December 2020, but continued to

27

make contributions to the household expenses, including the mortgage. Alvero further

28

STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-

testified that she co-managed the parties’ business CloudNine LLC and described her
management duties to include accounting, cleaning between renters, and bookings of
rental properties.

Alvero testified that the parties had two rental properties, which they rented

through Air B&B and the funds from the rental income were deposited into CloudNine
LLC Chase Bank account ending in 6992. The funds were then transferred into the
parties’ joint account ending in 8631 to pay for the household expenses. Alvero testified

that she considers her co-management of the business and the income earned therefrom
as her contribution to payment of household expenses as contemplated by Paragraph 6 of |
10

the Prenuptial Agreement. Alvero further testified that her understanding of the in-kind

il

contribution includes household chores which she testified were almost entirely done by

12

her because Wauters thought household chores were “beneath” him.

13

14
15

Wauters, during his direct testimony, confirmed that Alvero did the accounting for

the CloudNine LLC business during their marriage.
The Court credits Alvero’s testimony that she has made contribution towards .

16

payment of the mortgage and household expenses monetarily and in kind as contemplated

17

by Paragraph 6 of the Prenuptial Agreement.

18

Request to list the property for sale and Request for buy-out

19

|

Alvero is requesting this Court to order the sale of the marital residence. Wauters

20

appears to ask for this Court to allow him to buy-out Alvero’s interest in the marital

21

residence.

22

The parties do not have an agreement as to the fair market value of the marital

23

residence. Alvero as an owner testified that she believes the property is worth

“

24

$1,500,000. Wauters provided no testimony regarding the fair market value of the marital |

25

residence. Wauters filed a declaration attaching an appraisal report, however; this Court

26

cannot consider the declaration because the appraisal report was done by an expert that

27

was not properly disclosed, and the report was never offered or admitted into evidence.

28
STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-

8

The Court in Marriage of Cream defined fair market value as “the highest price on
the date of valuation that would be agreed to by a seller, being willing to sell but under no
obligation or urgent necessity to do so, and a buyer, being ready, willing and able to buy
but under no particular necessity for doing so.” In re Marriage of Cream (1993) 13 Cal.
App. 4th 81, 88,89.

Thus, absent competent evidence or an agreement on value, the Court must allow

the marital residence to be listed for sale and for the market to determine the value as

defined in Marriage of Cream.
Alvero also testified that she does not agree to a buy-out because Wauters actions,
10

(namely failure to pay the mortgage for 6 months) have led to damaging her credit and

ll

continues to affect her creditworthiness. During her testimony on June 21, 2023, Alvero

12

testified that the mortgage on the marital residence was in delinquent status from

13

February until June of 2023. In support of her testimony, Alvero proffered Petitioner’s

14

Exhibit 5 and 6 - Flagstar Bank mortgage statement dated May 16, 2023 and June 15,

15

2023, which were admitted into evidence. Petitioner’s Exhibit 5 shows account history of

16

an unpaid balance of $15,389.95 as of the date of the statement May 16, 2023. Alvero

17

also testified that the June 2023 mortgage payment was also outstanding, and the balance

18

had increased to $18,467.94 at the time of her testimony.

19

20

21

22

Wauters did not dispute the facts testified to by Alvero regarding his delinquency
and the unpaid balance of the mortgage as of June 21, 2023.

The Court credits Alvero the mortgage account was delinquent from February to
June 21, 2023.

23

During her testimony on September 21, 2023, Alvero also testified that Wauters

24

has not paid the SoCal gas bill for the marital residence for the period he lived atthe .

25

marital residence exclusively. Alvero has also testified that because of the damage to her

26

credit, this was the first year she was unable to co-sign a student loan for her sister and

27
28
STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-

believes the delinquent payments on the mortgage were the reason why she was no longer
able to do so.

She further testified that she was informed that Wauters did not qualify for
mortgage assistance or forbearance as he represented to the Court on June 21, 2023.

While Wauters has since paid the mortgage and brought it current as of September 2023,

Alvero has testified that she remains concerned about the mortgage and the damage to her
credit.

Wauters urges this Court to allow him to buy-out Alvero’s interest because her

_:;

contribution, pursuant to paragraph 6 (a) of the Prenuptial Agreement, is very little and he
10

can pay her the small amount she is owed, and take over the mortgage and ownership of

11

the marital residence. However, Wauters has demonstrated that he is not capable of

12

paying the mortgage, regardless of the amount. Wauters has not provided any evidence .

13

that he qualifies to refinance the mortgage on marital residence in his name only and buy;

14

out Alvero’s interest.

15

The Court credits Alvero’s testimony that she is concerned that allowing Wauters.,

16

to attempt to buy out her interest would prolong resolution of this matter and pose

17

unreasonable financial risk to her based on Wauters conduct with respect to the mortgage

18

payments.

19

Wauters’ Claim that his share of the Marital Residence is Greater than 65%

20

Wauters testified that for approximately 18 months he did not make any mortgage,

21

payments. He also testified that he received $49,000 from California Mortgage Relief

22

Program using the marital residence. He further testified this fund was sent directly to

23

pay for the mortgage which he had not for paid 18 months. In his verified response to

24

Form Interrogatories-Family Law number 8, Wauters states that he received California

25

Mortgage Relief Program monies on November 2, 2022, in the amount of $49,262.84.

26

Please see page 4 of Petitioner’s Exhibit 9, which was admitted into evidence during

27

Alvero’s testimony on June 21, 2023.

In addition to the $49,262.84 relief the parties received for the joint mortgage |

debt on the marital residence, Wauters rented the property between December 20, 2020, |
and the date of trial through Peerspace and Gigster.
Alvero testified that Wauters rented the marital residence through Peerspace and

earned $87,199.36 between December 20, 2020, and May 2023. During cross
examination on September 21, 2023, Wauters estimated that between May 2023 and the

date of trial he rented the property for an additional $2,000 to $3,000; and agreed the
total estimated earnings from Peerspace was over $90,000.
Alvero also testified that Wauters rented the marital residence through Gigster.
10

She testified that she believes Wauters has earned over $10,000 in income through

il

Gigster renting the marital residence.

12
13

14

Wauters testified that he has not provided any proof of the expenses relating to
the rent of the marital residence.

While Wauters maintains that Alvero has not contributed to the household

15

expenses or mortgage to qualify for the 35% interest as provided in the Deed, he has

16

benefitted from exclusive possession of the home and has received over $100,000 in

17

rental income and $49,262.84 in mortgage relief that paid for the mortgage on the

18

marital residence.

19

Alvero testified that she was employed between the date the parties acquired the

20

marital residence and the day she moved out. She testified that 65% of her paycheck was

21

deposited into the joint account bi-weekly to pay for household expenses, which

22

included the mortgage from her salary, and was involved in management of the renting

23

of the marital residence during this period.

24

Wauters attempted to discredit Alvero’s testimony regarding her contribution

25

alluding that she did not contribute in December of 2020. Alvero testified that she had

26

not lived in the home since October 2020 but contributed until December 15, 2020. In

27

support of her testimony, Alvero proffered Petitioner’s Exhibit 15- Chase Bank account ,

statement for the period of November 16, 2020 to December 16, 2020, which was

admitted into evidence. Alvero testified that her paycheck was directly deposited into the

joint account on December 15, 2020 and Wauters withdrew the funds on the same day.
The Court Credits Alvero that she has made contribution to the joint account in
December of 2020.

The Court also notes the provision at issue is vague and ambiguous and does not
alter the fact the parties each have a designated separate property interest in the marital

residence as reflected in the deed of trust.
Upon sale of the marital residence, Alvero requests that the costs of sale shall be .
10

split 65% payable from Wauters share, and 35% payable from Alvero’s share. Thereafter

11

the net proceeds from the sale of the residence shall be divided 65% to Wauters and 35%

Petitioner’s Request For Watts Charges

Alvero requests for this Court to charge Wauters rent from December 20, 2020,
until the home is sold. Alvero testified that she moved out of the marital residence on or

about December 20, 2020. Wauters does not dispute that Alvero moved out of the home
on December 20, 2020.

testified that Wauters did not abide by their agreement to separately remain in the marital

home and would often be in the home during the time designated for her. Alvero stated

25

that a few days before she returned to the marital residence in December 2020, Wauters

moved her personal belongings and locked her out of the marital residence. Wauters

moved “her clothing and belongings” into a shed and locked the shed. He also testified

that he locked the door even though he was aware that she would be coming to the
marital residence on a specific date to retrieve her items. Alvero testified that she had to
return to the home the next day (December 20, 2020) with police to retrieve her items.

Alvero is making a claim for personal property that was left in the marital residence as
discussed below.
Alvero testified that Wauters was bullying her to make financial commitments that
were not in her best interest. She also testified that during a dispute, Wauters physically

pushed her. She testified that due to Wauters presence in the marital residence after they
10

agreed he would not be there, his assault, and his repeated bullying to get her to agree to

his proposal, she felt unsafe and moved out of the residence as of December 20, 2020,

Rental Income Received by Wauters from the Marital Residence

During his exclusive possessions and while residing in the marital residence,

17

Wauters rented the marital residence for various projects using websites such as

18

Peerspace and Gigster. Alvero has testified that she has not received a verified

19

accounting, or a share of the profit from the rent. Wauters has testified that he provided

20

documents regarding the income he received in response to his Special Interrogatories but

21

admits that he did not include any expenses in his “accounting”.

22

As discussed above, both parties testified the marital residence was rented for over

23

$87,000 between December 20, 2020, and April 2023 through Peerspace. Wauters has

24

testified he earned $2,000 to $3,000 between May of 2023 and the date of trial (his

25

testimony was on September 25, 2023). During her June 21, 2023 testimony, Alvero

26

testified she believes Wauters has earned $10,000 in rental income through Gigster.

27

Wauters did not dispute Alvero’s testimony with respect to the income he earned through:

$100,000 in rental income through Peerspace and Gigster from January 2021 to April
2023.

Absent evidence of expenses of the rental, the Court credits $0 for expenses
incurred by Wauters as it relates to renting the property through Peerspace and Gigster.
In addition to the rent Wauters collected which is well over $100,000, Alvero has

proffered evidence that the property could have been rented for profit and earn consistent

rental income.

Expert Testimony on Fair Market Rental Value of the Marital Residence
10

Alvero’s expert Don L. Mowery testified that his associate has visited the marital

I]

residence and Mr. Mowery completed a rental survey on the marital residence. Mr.

12

Mowery was qualified as a certified real estate appraiser since 1992.

13

Mr. Mowery testified that he used the Uniform Standard of Professional Appraisal

14

Practice (““USPAP”) to determine the rental value of the marital residence. Based on the
;

15

standards set forth in the USPAP, Mr. Mowery testified that:

Wauters did not provide any evidence relating to the fair market rental value of the

marital residence.
Alvero testified that she did not receive any funds from the rental income after she
moved in December 20, 2020.

28

STATEMENT OF DECISION

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-~

15

Alvero is requesting that she receives 35% of the gross rental income the
community would have realized had the marital resident been rented. Pursuant to Mr.

Mowery’s testimony, the gross rental income between January 2021 and September
2023, as indicated below, would have totaled $132,000:

o

January 2021 to December 2021= $42,000 ($3,500 x 12 months)

o

January 2022 to September 2023= $90,000 ($4,500 x 20 months)

Based on the above, Alvero’s interest is $46,200.

Calculation of Mortgage, Tax and Insurance Payments by Wauters

The mortgage on the marital residence, including interest, is $3,077.99 per month.

10
11

Thus, the parties’ mortgage obligation between January 2021 to September 2023 would

12

have been $98,495.68.

13

Alvero estimated that the total paid for homeowner’s insurance is approximately

14

$2,304 ($72 per month for 32 months), and the total tax paid is approximately $32,000

15

($1,000 per month for $32 months).
Therefore, the total cost incurred by Wauters would have been $98,495.68 +

16
17

$2,304 + $32,000 = $132,799.68 (January 2021 to September 2023).

18

Mortgage ReliefPayment
As mentioned above, through his testimony, Wauters has confirmed that he did not

19
20

pay the mortgage on the marital residence for approximately 18 months after Alvero

21

moved out of the marital residence. This means Wauters did not pay $55,403.82

22

($3,077.99 x 18 months) using any income he earned during the 18 months to pay for the

23

mortgage, including the rental income that both parties testified was earned during this

24

period.

25

According to Wauters statement on page 4 of Petitioner’s Exhibit 9, Wauters

26

received $49,262.84 from the California Mortgage Relief Fund Program, which he

27

testified was paid directly to the lender. Alvero testified that she was not aware of this

16

fund being paid to Wauters until his response to the Form Interrogatories-Family Law
(Petitioner’s Exhibit 9) was served on May 3, 2023.
Since the California Mortgage Relief Fund Program was received on the basis of
ownership of the marital residence, Wauters’ mortgage, tax and insurance payment would

be $132,799.68 minus $49,262.84 = $83,537.68.
As discussed above, between December 20, 2020, and September 2023, Wauters

has earned over $100,000 by renting the marital residence through Peerspace and through
Gigster.
Thus, between December 20, 2020, and the date of the trial, Wauters has netted at
10

least $12,313.

I

Wauters claimed that he incurred costs for improvements and upkeep but has not:::

12

provided any evidence of the alleged costs. The testimony was limited to testimony of his

13

brother doing landscape and related handyman work while the brother stayed with

14

Wauters at the marital residence. Therefore, this Court assumes his improvement and

15

upkeep costs are $0.

16

Alvero requests the Court to order Wauters to pay her 35% of the net rental

17

income (after payment of the mortgage, insurance, and property taxes) he realized from

18

Peerspace, Gigster and the California Mortgage Relief Program from December 20, 2020;

19

to September 2023 as calculated below:

Alvero further testified that the parties paid the remaining balance from their joint

Petitioner’s Request for Division of Household Furniture, Furnishing
and Art (“household items’’)

Alvero testified that Wauters removed and hid the personal property they acquired

jointly during the marriage. Wauters admits that he removed over 90% of the community
property from the home, and removed Alvero’s personal belongings and locked them in a

shed or a storage space to which she had no access.
At the trial on September 13, 2023, to conserve time, the parties agreed that

Alvero’s direct testimony on matters relating to the motorcycle, personal property and
attorney’s fees would be by declaration. Her written testimony was filed on September
10
11
12

18, 2023, which she confirmed during her live testimony on September 19, 2023.

Alvero testified that the properties listed under HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE,
FURNISHINGS, APPLIANCES; and JEWELRY, ANTIQUES, ART, COINS,

COLLECTIONS on her Property Declaration (community) identified as Petitioner’s
14

Exhibit 12 contains the properties that Alvero testified were purchased during the

15

marriage. Petitioner’s Exhibit 12 was admitted into evidence during her testimony on

Case #: FDI-21-794666

-

20

Alvero estimates the value of the above assets to be between $2,200 to $3,000.
During cross examination by Wauters, Alvero also testified that the parties used
their credit cards to purchase household furniture etc. Wauters testified that the furniture

and furnishings were purchased after the parties had paid off their credit card debts prior
to the purchase of the marital residence.
Wauters alleges that Alvero received $30,000 loan from his father to pay off credit
card owed solely by Alvero. In support of his claim, Wauters presented the testimony of

his two brothers (Gregory and Araud Wauters) and his father Jean Jacque Wauters to
testify that Alvero received a loan to pay off her separate debt. During cross examination,
10

none of Wauters witnesses or Wauters can state with certainty that the $30,000 credit

iT

card debt was Alvero’s debt only. In fact, all four witnesses admitted that they did not

12

verify that the alleged $30,000 debt was Alvero’s debt only. All of Wauters’ witnesses

13

also stated that there was no written agreement between Alvero and Wauters’ father that -

14

she was receiving $30,000 as a loan. Wauters further testified that he did not go through

15

any credit card statement to verify that any of the alleged $30,000 debt in Alvero’s name

16

was solely her debt and was not incurred for the benefit of the community. Wauters and ,.

17

his father also testified that alleged $30,000 loan was not directly sent to Alvero.

18

There was no evidence that the $30,000 alleged loan was paid to Alvero for her to

19

pay her own expenses. The testimony surrounding the “loan” appeared to be the

20

foundation of an argument to support Wauters’ theory that Alvero’s 35% was somehow

21

conditioned upon her repayment of the purported loan. However, there was a lack of

22

clarity even by the witnesses offered by Wauters as to the amount of the loan and no

23

evidence, written or otherwise, other than Wauter’s argument, tying the loan as a

24

condition of the purchase of the property. Even were there found to be a loan, it is not

25

credited to Wauters as he is not owed the funds provided to Alvero.

Sy

26

During cross examination, Alvero also testified that she was able to retrieve some

27

of her personal property including a vehicle that was gifted to her by her mother prior to

the marriage. Alvero further testified that the items listed on Petitioner’s Exhibit 12 and
identified during her testimony were left in the home and are in possession of Wauters.
Pursuant to Family Code section 760, property acquired during the marriage is
community property subject to equal division.

Family Code section 2550 requires that

absent written agreement or oral stipulation of the parties, the Court “shall...divide the
community estate of the parties equally.”

The parties Prenuptial Agreement specifically states in Paragraph 6, subdivision

(c) that “[aJll jointly acquired property must be divided equally.”
Wauters has not provided any testimony or documents that any of the household
10

items Alvero identified in Petitioner’s Exhibit 12 and testified to on September 19, 2023

11

as additional items left in the marital residence to be his separate property.

12

13

14

The Court credits Alvero’s testimony with regards to description and valuation of
the household items in the marital residence.

Alvero is requesting that Wauters pay her $7,500 for her share of the household

15

items. During his testimony, Wauters did not provide evidence of alternate valuation of

16

the household items acquired during the marriage.

17

Findings and Order Regarding Division of Personal Property

18

Based on the foregoing evidence, the Court finds that the total value for the
