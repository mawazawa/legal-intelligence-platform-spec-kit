### ¶27: MAY 30, 2025 - ESCROW CLOSES

**THEIR CLAIM**:
> "Escrow closed on May 30, 2025, and $280,355.83 was deposited into our firm's account."

**YOUR RESPONSE**:
✓ Acknowledged - this is factual.

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT**:
"Escrow closed on May 30, 2025. The Final Sellers Closing Statement shows net proceeds of $280,355.83 to sellers. However, this figure does not account for the complete FTB tax burden as required by *In re Marriage of Epstein*."

---

### ¶28: EXHIBIT 9 - THEIR CALCULATION

**THEIR CLAIM**:
> "Attached as EXHIBIT 9 is a true and correct copy of the calculation created by my office substantiating my client's request for interest to be added to the funds owed to her pursuant to the June 27, 2024, Judgment."

**EXHIBIT 9**: Their financial calculation (THE $358,155.71 PHANTOM)

**YOUR RESPONSE**:
🚨 **THIS IS THE CRITICAL EXHIBIT** - This is where they show the fake $358,155.71 calculation

**COUNTER-ARGUMENT**:
"Exhibit 9 contains fundamental mathematical errors that render Petitioner's requested relief impossible:

1. **Phantom Base**: Petitioner claims 'total net proceed' of $358,155.71, which is $77,799.88 more than the actual net proceeds of $280,355.83 shown on the Final Sellers Closing Statement.

2. **Double-Counting**: Petitioner attempts to both deduct $77,779.88 in mortgage arrears from proceeds AND add it back to create this fictional base.

3. **Tax Law Violation**: Under *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76 (1979), ALL taxes from a court-ordered sale must be deducted before dividing proceeds. Petitioner's calculation deducts only her $13,694.62 withholding but fails to deduct my $25,432.88 tax obligation.

The correct calculation is set forth in my declaration at ¶¶ [NUMBERS]."
