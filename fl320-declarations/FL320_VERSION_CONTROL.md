## Notes for Attorney (Tom Rotert)

### Key Legal Arguments to Emphasize

1. **Epstein Rule Application**:
   - *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76 (1979)
   - When court orders property sold, ALL taxes from that sale must be deducted before dividing proceeds
   - Total FTB tax = $39,127.50 should be deducted before 65/35 split
   - True net proceeds = $241,248.33 (not $280,355.83)

2. **Petitioner's Mathematical Errors**:
   - Phantom $358,155.71 base (invented $77,799.88)
   - Double-counting arrears already paid to lender
   - Asymmetric tax treatment (only her withholding counted, not Mathieu's obligation)

3. **FTB Withholding Evidence**:
   - FTB Publication 1016: "Calculate withholding for multiple sellers by applying rate to each seller's proportion"
   - Melinda Cook's emails confirming 3.33% requirement
   - Actual withholding shown on closing statement: $13,694.62

4. **Furniture Theft**:
   - Court ordered Mathieu to pay Rosanna $7,500 for furniture
   - Rosanna texted Piya (Mathieu's wife) saying furniture must stay
   - Then Rosanna took the furniture anyway
   - Should be $7,500 credit to Mathieu, not payment = $15,000 swing
