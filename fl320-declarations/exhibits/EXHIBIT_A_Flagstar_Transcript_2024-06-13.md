[Contact information verification omitted for brevity]

**Alex**: Okay, let's see. So just to start from the beginning, basically. Right now, the loan shows pass you total of $24,000 $286.63. You able to bring the loan current today?

**Me**: No.

**Alex**: Gotcha, okay. So let's see. So just to make you give you the full update. **So right now the home is in foreclosure as of the 11th. Uh, so I want to make you aware of that. There's no cell date yet, so we got plenty of time.** So it's uh best to just start the review for the options to see what it qualifies for.

**Me**: Okay, you can suspend the foreclosure.

**Alex**: Okay. For example, if you do come into the funds, uh, to reinstate the loan, you normally have to call the attorney, and then you're gonna have to request a reinstatement quote. Uh, it takes about a week. They'll send it to you, and then from there, you just, um, uh, gives you the amount you have to pay, and then they have to pay it. So if you ever can do that, you can just reach out to them. This is other information in case you don't have it. Uh, it's called, uh, Z E, which is Z I, E V E, and then it's Broaden X, B R 0, D, N for Nancy, A, and then X, and Steel. S T-E-E-L-E. That's the names. The phone number is 714-848-7920.

[Spelling verification omitted]

**Alex**: Besides that, it's, of course, it's applying for lost mitigation. Right. So normally reviews you for different options like, um, there's a repayment plan. Uh, there's a delinquent T deferral to try to push it to the end, and then there is a loan modification, which can help modify the loan, help lower the payment. There is options to leave the home. We have to mention too. It's called a short sale, and then indeed in lieu of foreclosure, things like that.

**Me**: When you say, um... Sorry, when you say there is plenty of time, how much time do you mean?

**Alex**: **Well, it depends. There's no cell days, like sometimes it takes a month to get it, too, just all depends. But normally, like, if you start this review, that we can start today, it suspends it, so the review takes 30 days, sometimes longer, it just depends. So you know, at least that amount of time.** And then, uh, if you get approved, then, you know, you have to decide if you want to do the option or not, if it's not approved for example, then, you know, the best thing to do is try to pay everything before, like, a cell date.

**Me**: And then, so if, if today I start the, uh, the, uh, review, so that, that gives me 30 days, uh, for the review, and then how many days after that, do I have, uh, to then uh, decide on on the options?

**Alex**: Well, the way it works is, so we're going to ask you a question today over the phone, is just to start the process. Uh, you just should call back a week later, and they're gonna tell you if your loss mitigation application is, uh, quote unquote complete. Because they do paperless now, so you don't have to do it in full. **So as long as we tell you next time that your packet is complete, then the review will start then, and yes, it should suspend the foreclosure. Uh and then it takes 30 days. It just depends. It could be longer, less, it depends, but normally 30 days.** And then, uh, from there, if there's a, if you're done on is approved, then we'll let you know about it, and then you just decide if you want to do it basically, uh, or like say, see what other options might be available.

[Loss mitigation options discussion continues]

**Me**: So the, the house is not at risk of uh, foreclosure for in the next uh, 60 days, let's say.

**Alex**: **Well, whenever the packet is complete, so it's still going to be active until we get all those documents and they tell you that the packet is complete, only then they can possibly be suspended.**

## SIGNIFICANCE TO CASE

This recorded call, made on **June 13, 2024** (two days after the foreclosure initiation date referenced in Petitioner's attorney's ¶4), directly contradicts Petitioner's narrative that foreclosure was imminent or that Respondent was ignoring the situation.

**Key Facts from This Call**:
1. Foreclosure had just started on June 11, 2024
2. There was **no sale date** as of June 13, 2024
3. Flagstar agent described the situation as having "**plenty of time**"
4. Loss mitigation application would **suspend foreclosure** during 30-day review
5. I immediately applied for loss mitigation options on this call

This demonstrates:
- Proactive action by Respondent (calling bank 2 days after foreclosure initiation)
- No urgency or imminent risk as of June 2024
- Proper pursuit of loss mitigation options as advised by lender
