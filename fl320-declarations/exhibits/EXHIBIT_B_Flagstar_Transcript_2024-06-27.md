## TRANSCRIPT

**[Call begins with automated system messages - omitted for brevity]**

**Agent (Chris)**: Thank you for calling Flankstrap Bank. My name is Chris, can I have your loan number?

**Me**: Yes, hi. My name is Matthew Waters, and I'm calling on a recorded line, and my loan number is one sec. 441-463663.

**Chris**: Okay. All right, do I know your name, sir?

**Me**: My name is Matthew Waters.

**Chris**: Hi, Ms. Waters, what's the last 4 of your social security number?

**Me**: 3608.

**Chris**: All right, Mr. Waters, what's your property address?

**Me**: The property address is 3525 8th Avenue. Los Angeles, California, 90018.

**Chris**: Okay. All right, so thank you, Mr. Swanners, on cursive Flagstar Banks, consumer collections department, and **we don't give permission for recording file**, but we'll check out some of the contact information here for you. What's your cell phone number?

**Me**: What did you say about the permission of the what?

**Chris**: Oh, I'm just saying **I don't give permission for the recording of the call**, just to put that out there. You do give permission. You do or you do not?

**Me**: Well, no, **we don't give permission for recording the call**, what we're saying, sir.

**Me**: Oh. Okay. Because you said you had a recorded line there. But anyways, um, so then, uh, what's the uh, cell phone number, sir?

**Me**: The cell phone number is 347-574-3963.

[Contact verification continues]

**Chris**: All right, so thanks for that. So, uh, **looks like it's in an active foreclosure. Are you able to pay the total amount to reinstate it, sir?**

**Me**: So, I'm calling because I submitted a, uh, application, um, for, uh, Um, What's it called? Um, loss mitigation? No, for. Um. Sorry, I'm I'm blanking on the word. Uh, the thing where you you have to not pay for a little while, um, Forbear?

**Chris**: Yeah, forbearance. Exactly.

**Me**: So I called a few weeks ago, um, and was told that I could apply for forbearance, that I qualified for that, and uh, There's 2 ways to do it. One is with the online form and the other one is to download the form and then, you know, email it or fax it or something like that. And I did the online one and I just wanted to see if that had been received and if that had been considered.

**Chris**: Okay, what was the date that you faxed it, sir?

**Me**: I did not fax it. I did the online version.

**Chris**: Oh, when did you upload it?

**Me**: Uh, around uh, June 14th.

**Chris**: Okay. Well, we'll take a look here. We'll look at a few things. So then you're reinstating it by payment out of foreclosure, is that correct?

**Me**: Uh, I don't understand.

**Chris**: Also, for example, um, when it's in an active foreclosure, if someone is choosing to apply for hardship and use the special options to get things back to current, that's the lost litigation, right? And then sometimes, as someone's not doing that, if they're just paying the entire total amount of too by themselves at once to get it out of foreclosure, that's called a reinstatement there. Yeah. So it sounds like you're applying for the assistance options, you're not being stating it by yourself, correct?

**Me**: As of now, yeah, that's correct.

**Chris**: Okay. That's fine. So, uh, if you got any correspondence from the foreclosure attorneys, uh, that's Steve, Bradneck, and Steele with a 714-848-7920. So we're gonna go take a look at here. We'll look at a few things here. So, uh, 1st we'll look and see. It shows that there was a launch litigation review here. Um, because it looked like at some point, they've been trying to do, like, a flex modification at some point, but apparently, it looks like that things closed down, so they sent an adverse action letter back on June 3rd. Uh, so that that was after that point that you resend some documents for review, is that correct?

**Me**: Yeah.

**Chris**: Okay. So I have to look in the imaging system for a moment. Thank you.

[Brief hold]

**Chris**: And, uh, you're welcome. And we'll look at a few other things here. Uh, so let's see here. **Okay, so there's no sale date, so that's okay.**

**Me**: There's no sale date?

**Chris**: **Yeah, there's no foreclosure sale date, so that's good.**

[Discussion of hardship situation and assumption possibilities - omitted for brevity]

**Chris**: **And then otherwise, there's also a phone number, which at the end here, if we want to transfer to it, because some of those intricate questions that we wouldn't know on this side, but the phone number is 866.**

[Assumption department contact information exchange]

**Me**: **And what is the, um... The, um, the loss mitigation uh, email, is it loss mitigation department at flagstore.com?**

**Chris**: Well, no, it's an assumption that's going to be handled by loss litigation, because they're already working on the account and it's assumption processing. at flagstar.com.

**Me**: Okay, assumption processing.

**Chris**: Yeah. So that's for if that's started being handled by Las Vegas. So, um, so then you said if this is correct, the plan was you were gonna be keeping the property, right?

**Me**: Yeah.

**Chris**: Okay. Now, um, **I'm gonna first look and see if it shows this image in the system, and then we'll know if it's in the middle of trying to get processed here.** I know that they didn't send a, uh, acknowledgement letters, so I know that they haven't, like, confirmed it, just a complete package, so we got to take a look here. Uh, let's see here. So I'm gonna go back to... Go back in time here. Um. I'll go back a little bit before the 14th. Let's go back to the 12.

[Agent searches system]

**Chris**: **So, to be honest, 100%, I do not see where it was successfully imaged and being reviewed. So I'm gonna say that I would resend that, because it just doesn't show that it was received an image.** So, um, I'd refund that. Or **we might be able to do an application over the phone here.** might be able to do that. Let me see.

**Me**: Yeah, let's do that.

**Chris**: So let's see we can do. Well, 1st we're gonna mention the options first, actually.

[Loss mitigation options explained - repayment plan, forbearance, deferral, modification, short sale, deed in lieu]

**Chris**: So did you need hardship assistance to help resolve things for you? Uh, Mr. Waters?

**Me**: Yeah.

**Chris**: Okay. Do you need consideration for reduced monthly payment amount?

**Me**: Um, For now, I would like to start with asking for a forbearance so that I can get my affairs in order.

**Chris**: Oh, no, no, I get that. I mean, these are just very general questions. I mean, just generally speaking, in a way. Do you need consideration for a reduced monthly payment amount to make things easier?

**Me**: Yes.

**Chris**: Okay. All right, **so we submit the requests for review. So now you can skip having to fix that in there. So we submit the request for reviews so you get a basic acknowledgement letter in about 5 to 7 dates that just means they're working on it. But the actual decision probably allow about 30 days then for the actual decision on the request for assistance.** So that's good we could do it the easy way there.

[Discussion of grace period and late fees]

**Chris**: So, um, **the only review for all the options, do their due diligence, so we'll start the review process and then see what the decision outcome is.** So that's our start for today, and then anything else we could do for you, sir?

**Me**: Yeah, could I please get an email to say that, um, I've, you know, that we've done this, uh, application over the phone, and that it's being reviewed, some kind of confirmation?

**Chris**: Well, I mean, like I said, they sent out a confirmation letter by mail, so that's coming out, but I mean, there isn't something like a, there isn't an email that we sent to go with it.

**Me**: But you're saying that, um, You're saying that the... that the uh, Application for forbearance has been, has been put through right now, and that it is 7 days under review, and then 30 days up to 30 days to get a response.

**Chris**: Right. So this is the way to think of it. So, you know, as you know, you can fix in the documents and do it the long form way. And then sometimes we could just do a few questions, just to start through a few process over the phone. **So it's not too dissimilar that when you fax in a hardship form. It's one form to be reviewed for everything, and same thing when we do it over the phone, it's just a couple of questions, and it's gonna be reviewed for everything, so they're gonna look at all the options.**

**Me**: Yeah, and does that pause, does that pause the foreclosure action?

**Chris**: Uh, you know, that is an excellent question. So let me look at something here, according to state here. **Some states can suspend it, some states it does not. Um, and this is California, so, uh, yeah, as far as what I can tell, the foreclosure kind of still stays, until the option is actually finalized, and California is one of those states.** So it most likely won't suspend the foreclosure. It will not suspend the foreclosure.

**Me**: Right. So meaning the foreclosure just keeps going.

**Chris**: Well, it's in the process. **Like we said, the good news was they don't have a sale date.** I mean, there's not anything immediately established in that regard. So, it could well be that they got something figured out before that might happen.

**Me**: Right, but this in itself does not halt or pause the foreclosure proceedings. It just keeps going.

**Chris**: Well, right, unless they give you an option that states otherwise. I mean, I don't know how they worked that if they give you forbearance, if they're able to do that, but, uh, but **I mean, based on what we know at this time, I wouldn't think that anything would be suspended unless they're notifying you officially otherwise. So I would say that, at this point, it's not going to suspend anything, it's going to be active, but that doesn't mean that they've established the sale date.** Because that's 2 different things there.

**Me**: And what does it take to get a sale date or, I mean, I don't want to have a sale date, obviously, but what happens in the process? Where are we in the timeline of things?

**Chris**: **Well, it's a 7 months fast too. So I think that they declared it to be an active foreclosure back on, uh, Well, that was earlier this month. I think that they, uh, they were looking at still trying to do the modification and it didn't work, so they closed it down. So I think that the date that they looked at the foreclosure began on June 11th. Um, So, in some ways, that's kind of somewhat relatively recent, that they just started the template**, but as far as how long it's gonna take for them to establish a sale date that, I don't know.

**Me**: Do you know how long it takes on average?

**Chris**: No, I don't know what the timeline would be.

**Me**: Okay. But, I mean, if you're gonna look at it this way, man, **this is probably the best situation right now**, because if we were able to do it over the phone and just kind of start the review process, They're not gonna be holding a bank or, you know, unless they make a specific request to you for a document, you don't even have to start off with that. **So at least we're starting things now. And they should know something within, you know, roughly 30 days, so, uh, so this is kind of the best situation you could have**, given, you know, what's the situation at hand there?
