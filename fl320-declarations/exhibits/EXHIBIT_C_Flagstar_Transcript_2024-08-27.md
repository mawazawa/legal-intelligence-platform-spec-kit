## KEY EXCERPTS (For Court Reference)

### Excerpt 1: FIRST MENTION of Tentative Sale Date (August 27, 2024)
**Me**: "Oh, I wanted to check on the status of the mortgage, and **I was told that there was a tentative foreclosure sale date for end of October 26th**, and I wanted to see if I could, because I just regain significant income, and I could, make the loan current and also resume payments."

## SIGNIFICANCE TO CASE

This recorded call, made on **August 27, 2024** (2.5 months after Petitioner's attorney's ¶4 claim about foreclosure warnings), is the **FIRST TIME** a foreclosure sale date is mentioned.

**Key Facts from This Call**:
1. As of August 27, 2024, a **tentative** sale date of October 26, 2024 had been set
2. This was **2.5 months AFTER** Petitioner's attorney's June 11, 2024 claim
3. I still had appeal rights (30 days until September 6, 2024)
4. Foreclosure was in "suspended" status pending appeal
5. I was actively attempting to reinstate and resume payments

**Timeline Comparison**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| June 11, 2024 | Foreclosure initiated (per Petitioner's ¶4) |
| June 13, 2024 | I called Flagstar - Agent: "**No sale date, plenty of time**" |
| June 27, 2024 | I called Flagstar - Agent: "**No sale date, best situation**" |
| **August 27, 2024** | **FIRST mention of tentative sale date (Oct 26, 2024)** |

This demonstrates:
- Petitioner's ¶4 created false sense of urgency in June 2024
- Reality: No sale date existed for 2.5 months after foreclosure initiation
- I was continuously engaging with lender throughout entire period
- First tentative sale date was 4 months into the future (Oct 26 from June 11)
