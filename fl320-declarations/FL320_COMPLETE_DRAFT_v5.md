## DECLARATION OF MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS

I, Mathieu Christian Yves Wauters, declare as follows:

---

### I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

1. I am the Respondent in this dissolution proceeding. I submit this declaration in opposition to Petitioner's Request for Order filed June 25, 2025, which seeks redistribution of escrow proceeds from the court-ordered sale of the community property residence located at 3525 8th Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90018 ("the Property").

2. Each statement in this declaration is true and based on my personal knowledge, except where stated on information and belief. If called as a witness, I could and would testify competently to these facts. I make this declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 2009 and 2015.5, California Rules of Court, rule 5.111, and *Reifler v. Superior Court* (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 479.

3. I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing statements are true and correct to the best of my knowledge, information, and belief.

---

### II. RESPONSE TO PETITIONER'S ATTORNEY'S DECLARATION

Petitioner's attorney, Selam Gezahegn, filed a declaration containing 28 paragraphs in support of the Request for Order. I respond to each claim paragraph-by-paragraph, supported by contemporaneous documentary evidence.

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 1-2: PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS

4. I acknowledge paragraphs 1 and 2 of Ms. Gezahegn's declaration, which contain standard legal language regarding her personal knowledge and attorney credentials. I have no response to these preliminary statements.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 3: MAY 1, 2024 LETTER

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶3)**:
> "On May 1, 2024, I sent a letter to the Respondent requesting for his agreement to list the property for sale and proposing several realtors for his consideration... My office did not receive a response to this letter from the Respondent."

**My Response**:

5. I received Petitioner's attorney's letter dated May 1, 2024, proposing realtors for listing the Property. At that time, I was reviewing the proposed realtors and considering my options. I was also consulting with friends and family about the sale process, as I did not yet have retained counsel.

6. I did not formally respond to the May 1, 2024 letter because I was attempting to work cooperatively with Petitioner to avoid unnecessary litigation. I had no objection to selling the Property; my concern was ensuring the sale process was fair and that both parties' interests were protected.

7. Contrary to Ms. Gezahegn's implication that I was uncooperative, I was actively preparing the Property for sale and engaging in good faith discussions about the process.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 4: JUNE 11, 2024 FORECLOSURE CLAIM

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶4)**:
> "On June 11, 2024, I was informed by my client that the mortgage company will be sending letters regarding foreclosure due to the outstanding unpaid mortgage."

**My Response**:

8. Paragraph 4 of Ms. Gezahegn's declaration is vague, misleading, and contradicted by contemporaneous recorded evidence. Ms. Gezahegn does not claim she received a foreclosure notice; rather, she states only that her "client told her" that the mortgage company "will be sending letters" (emphasis added). This is hearsay about a future possibility, not a statement of fact about an imminent foreclosure.

9. On **June 13, 2024** (two days after the date referenced in ¶4), I personally called Flagstar Bank on a recorded line to inquire about the foreclosure status and explore loss mitigation options. The Flagstar collections agent, Alex, confirmed:

   > "So right now the home is in foreclosure as of the 11th. Uh, so I want to make you aware of that. **There's no cell date yet, so we got plenty of time.**"

10. When I asked how much time, Alex explained:

    > "Well, it depends. There's no cell days, like sometimes it takes a month to get it, too, just all depends. **But normally, like, if you start this review, that we can start today, it suspends it, so the review takes 30 days, sometimes longer, it just depends.** So you know, at least that amount of time."

11. Alex further confirmed that submitting a loss mitigation application would suspend the foreclosure during the review period:

    > "So as long as we tell you next time that your packet is complete, then the review will start then, and **yes, it should suspend the foreclosure. Uh and then it takes 30 days.** It just depends. It could be longer, less, it depends, but normally 30 days."

12. I immediately applied for loss mitigation options (forbearance and loan modification) during the June 13, 2024 call, demonstrating my proactive engagement with the lender.

13. On **June 27, 2024** (16 days after the foreclosure initiation), I called Flagstar Bank again. Agent Chris confirmed:

    > "Okay, so **there's no sale date, so that's okay.**"

    When I asked for clarification, Chris repeated:

    > "Yeah, **there's no foreclosure sale date, so that's good.**"

14. Chris further explained that the foreclosure process had just begun:

    > "So I think that they declared it to be an active foreclosure back on... Well, that was earlier this month... So I think that the date that they looked at the foreclosure began on June 11th. Um, **So, in some ways, that's kind of somewhat relatively recent, that they just started the template**..."

15. Chris characterized the situation positively:

    > "But, I mean, if you're gonna look at it this way, man, **this is probably the best situation right now**, because if we were able to do it over the phone and just kind of start the review process... **So at least we're starting things now. And they should know something within, you know, roughly 30 days, so, uh, so this is kind of the best situation you could have**, given, you know, what's the situation at hand there?"

16. During the June 27, 2024 call, I successfully submitted a loss mitigation application over the phone, further demonstrating my continued proactive efforts to resolve the delinquency.

17. It was not until **August 27, 2024** (more than 2.5 months after Ms. Gezahegn's ¶4 claim) that Flagstar Bank first mentioned a **tentative** foreclosure sale date of October 26, 2024. Even then, I still had appeal rights extending through September 6, 2024.

18. **Timeline Summary**:

    | Date | Event | Foreclosure Sale Date |
    |------|-------|----------------------|
    | June 11, 2024 | Foreclosure initiated | None |
    | June 13, 2024 | I called Flagstar - "**No sale date, plenty of time**" | None |
    | June 27, 2024 | I called Flagstar - "**No sale date, best situation**" | None |
    | August 27, 2024 | First mention of **tentative** sale date | October 26, 2024 (tentative) |

19. Ms. Gezahegn's vague ¶4 statement creates a false impression that foreclosure was imminent in June 2024, when in reality:
    - There was no sale date in June 2024
    - Flagstar agents described the situation as having "plenty of time" and "the best situation"
    - I immediately applied for loss mitigation options that would suspend foreclosure
    - The first tentative sale date was not set until 2.5 months later
    - I was continuously and proactively engaging with the lender throughout this entire period

20. **Attached as Exhibit 1** is a true and correct copy of the transcript of my recorded telephone call with Flagstar Bank on June 13, 2024.

21. **Attached as Exhibit 2** is a true and correct copy of the transcript of my recorded telephone call with Flagstar Bank on June 27, 2024.

22. **Attached as Exhibit 3** is a true and correct copy of the transcript of my recorded telephone call with Flagstar Bank on August 27, 2024.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 5: JUNE 14, 2024 EX PARTE REQUEST

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶5)**:
> "On June 14, 2024, my office provided notice and filed an ex parte Request to list the property for sale, to appoint Ron Melendez as a realtor, and to designate the Clerk of Court as Elisor to sign in the event that the Respondent refuses. The Court held a hearing on July 2, 2024 and issued orders which were incorporated into a Findings and Order After Hearing filed on July 12, 2024."

**My Response**:

23. I acknowledge that Petitioner's attorney filed an ex parte request on June 14, 2024. At that time, I was not yet represented by counsel and was attempting to navigate this complex legal process on my own.

24. I attended the July 2, 2024 hearing [IF TRUE - OTHERWISE STATE: I did not attend the July 2, 2024 hearing because [REASON]]. The Court's July 12, 2024 Findings and Order After Hearing [DESCRIBE WHAT IT ORDERED - e.g., "ordered the Property listed for sale and appointed Ron Melendez as the listing agent"].

25. I did not object to the appointment of Ron Melendez as the listing agent. My primary concern was ensuring the sale process was conducted fairly and transparently, protecting both parties' interests in the community property.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 6: JULY 9, 2024 ALLEGED FAILURE TO SIGN

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶6)**:
> "I was informed by my client and Ron Menendez that Respondent had not signed the listing agreement by July 9, 2024 as ordered."

**My Response**:

26. The Court's July 12, 2024 order [INSERT ACTUAL DEADLINE FROM ORDER - e.g., "required signature by July 20, 2024" OR "did not specify a July 9, 2024 deadline"]. Ms. Gezahegn's statement that I was "ordered" to sign by July 9, 2024 is [CORRECT/INCORRECT - verify against actual court order].

27. [IF YOU DIDN'T SIGN BY JULY 9: I did not sign the listing agreement by July 9, 2024 because [PROVIDE REASON - e.g., "I was reviewing the terms with advisors," "I had concerns about certain provisions," "I was attempting to retain counsel," etc.].]

28. [IF YOU EVENTUALLY SIGNED: I signed the listing agreement on [DATE].] [IF YOU NEVER SIGNED: The listing agreement was ultimately signed by the Court-appointed Elisor on August 13, 2024, as Ms. Gezahegn admits in ¶7.]

---

#### PARAGRAPH 7: ELISOR SIGNATURE DELAY

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶7)**:
> "On July 22, 2024, my office contacted the Court to have Elisor signature on the listing agreement. I was informed by the Court's clerk that the Elisor will not sign any document without first having the managing attorney review the documents prior to scheduling any appointment for signatures. On August 13, 2024, the listing agreement was signed by the Elisor."

**My Response**:

29. The delay in obtaining the Elisor's signature was not caused by any action or inaction on my part. As Ms. Gezahegn herself admits, the Court clerk required the managing attorney to review documents before scheduling the Elisor's signature appointment. This administrative process took from July 22, 2024 to August 13, 2024—more than three weeks.

30. During this period, I was cooperating with the sale process and preparing the Property for listing. Any delay in the Elisor's signature was attributable to court administrative procedures, not to any obstruction by me.

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 8-9: AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 2024 POSSESSION DISPUTE

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶8-9)**:
> "On August 9, 2024, my office noticed and filed another ex parte Request seeking to award my client sole possession of the property to prepare it for sale... On September 12, 2024... The Court directed the Respondent to prepare the property and make it accessible for Mr. Melendez by September 26, 2024."

**My Response**:

31. In August 2024, I was [STILL RESIDING IN/HAD ALREADY VACATED] the Property. [IF STILL THERE: I was making good-faith efforts to prepare for the transition and cooperate with the sale process.]

32. Petitioner's request for "sole possession" in August 2024 was [DESCRIBE SITUATION - e.g., "premature, as I was actively preparing to vacate," "unnecessary, as I had already indicated my willingness to cooperate," etc.].

33. Following the Court's September 12, 2024 order, I [DID/DID NOT] make the Property accessible to Mr. Melendez by September 26, 2024. [IF DID: I complied with the Court's order.] [IF DID NOT: The reason was [EXPLAIN - e.g., "I was in the process of coordinating the logistics of my move," "I had safety concerns about allowing access while my belongings were still present," etc.].]

---

#### PARAGRAPH 10: OCTOBER 2, 2024 PHOTOGRAPHY CANCELLATION

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶10)**:
> "On or before October 2, 2024, I was informed by Mr. Melendez that Respondent failed to cooperate with him and had not provided access to the home. Mr. Melendez further informed me that he had to cancel the scheduled photography because he did not receive confirmation from Respondent to enter the home for that purpose."

**My Response**:

34. [IF YOU PROVIDED ACCESS: Mr. Melendez's claim that I "failed to cooperate" is false. I [PROVIDED ACCESS/ATTEMPTED TO COORDINATE ACCESS] on [DATES]. The photography may have been cancelled due to [SCHEDULING CONFLICTS/MISCOMMUNICATION], not due to my refusal to cooperate.]

35. [IF YOU DID NOT PROVIDE ACCESS: I did not provide access for photography on [DATE] because [PROVIDE VALID REASON - e.g., "I was not given adequate notice," "I had safety concerns about allowing access while my personal belongings were still in the Property," "I was in the process of coordinating my final move," etc.].]

36. [IF APPLICABLE: Throughout this period, I was communicating with [MR. MELENDEZ/PETITIONER'S ATTORNEY/OTHER] regarding access and scheduling. Any difficulties in coordination were due to [EXPLAIN].]

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 11-15: NOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2024 PERSONAL PROPERTY DISPUTE

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶11-15)**:
> "On or about November 16, 2024, my client asked me to prepare and send a letter to Respondent regarding the personal items he left behind when he vacated the property... On November 18, 2024, I sent Respondent a letter asking him to remove the items by November 30, 2024... On December 9, 2024, I sent a second letter... Respondent did not respond to my letter and it is my understanding that the items were not retrieved by Respondent."

**My Response**:

37. I vacated the Property on or about November 16, 2024, in compliance with the Court's orders granting Petitioner possession of the Property.

38. When I vacated, I left behind [DESCRIBE ITEMS - e.g., "certain furniture and household items that the Court had previously ordered me to leave for Petitioner," "items that I intended to retrieve but did not have time or resources to move immediately," etc.].

39. I received Ms. Gezahegn's November 18, 2024 letter requesting that I remove personal items by November 30, 2024. My wife, Piya Wauters, went to the Property on November 30, 2024 to retrieve items.

40. [DESCRIBE WHAT HAPPENED ON NOVEMBER 30: e.g., "When Piya arrived, Petitioner [ALLOWED/PREVENTED] her from retrieving items," "Piya retrieved [WHAT ITEMS]," "Petitioner told Piya that certain items, including furniture, should remain in the Property and would not need to be removed," etc.].

41. **Critical Fact Regarding Furniture**: On or about [DATE], Petitioner sent a text message to my wife, Piya Wauters, stating that the furniture should remain in the Property and would not need to be removed. Based on this explicit representation by Petitioner, I left the furniture in place as requested.

42. **Attached as Exhibit 4** is a true and correct copy of the text message exchange between Petitioner Rosanna Claire Alvero and Piya Wauters regarding the furniture remaining in the Property.

43. I [DID/DID NOT] respond to Ms. Gezahegn's December 9, 2024 letter. [IF DID NOT RESPOND: I did not respond because [EXPLAIN - e.g., "I relied on Petitioner's representation to Piya that the furniture should remain," "I believed the issue had been resolved through the November 30 retrieval," etc.].]

44. [IF ITEMS REMAINED: The items that remained in the Property after December 2024 were [FURNITURE THAT PETITIONER TOLD PIYA SHOULD STAY/OTHER - EXPLAIN].]

---

#### PARAGRAPH 14: DECEMBER 6, 2024 LEGAL NOTICE

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶14)**:
> "On December 6, 2024, I received an email enclosing a letter from Respondent with the subject line 'Legal Notice of Unlawful Self-Help Eviction Activities, Intimidation, and Evidence of Tampering at 3525 8th Ave - Response to Your Letter.'"

**My Response**:

45. On December 6, 2024, I sent a letter to Petitioner's attorney in response to [WHAT PROMPTED IT - e.g., "concerning communications I had received," "actions by Petitioner that I believed constituted unlawful self-help eviction," "evidence of tampering with my belongings at the Property," etc.].

46. My December 6, 2024 letter documented [DESCRIBE WHAT YOU DOCUMENTED - e.g., "specific incidents of intimidation," "evidence that Petitioner had changed locks without proper notice," "missing or damaged personal property," etc.].

47. My concerns were valid and supported by [EVIDENCE - e.g., "photographs," "witness statements," "communications from Petitioner," etc.]. I sent the letter to protect my legal rights and create a contemporaneous record of Petitioner's conduct.

48. **Attached as Exhibit 5** is a true and correct copy of my December 6, 2024 letter to Petitioner's attorney.

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 16-19: APRIL-MAY 2025 ESCROW DOCUMENT DELAYS

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶16-19)**:
> "On or about April 20, 2025, I was informed that there was an interested buyer... Respondent was delaying signature on the necessary documents... On the morning of May 1, 2025, I was notified by the Escrow agent that the Respondent has signed the documents..."

**My Response**:

49. In April 2025, I was working with my attorney, Thomas J. Rotert, to review the escrow documents and ensure that all terms were fair and complied with the Court's orders. Any delay in signing was due to proper legal review, not obstruction or bad faith.

50. I was concerned about [DESCRIBE CONCERNS - e.g., "ensuring the distribution of proceeds would be calculated correctly," "protecting my rights under the Statement of Decision," "understanding the tax implications of the sale," etc.].

51. I signed the escrow documents on [DATE - verify from your records], after completing my legal review with Mr. Rotert. At no time did I refuse to sign or indicate an intention to obstruct the sale.

52. Ms. Gezahegn's characterization that I was "delaying" the documents misrepresents my good-faith efforts to ensure legal compliance. Petitioner and her attorney were rushing the process, while I was exercising my right to review documents with counsel before signing.

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 20-21: MAY 1, 2025 NOTICE OF TRUSTEE'S SALE

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶20-21)**:
> "On May 1, 2025, I was served with a Notice of Trustee's sale, notifying that the property was scheduled to be sold by the lender at an auction on May 29, 2025, at 9AM."

**My Response**:

53. The Notice of Trustee's Sale scheduled for May 29, 2025 was the result of [EXPLAIN - e.g., "the mortgage arrears that had accumulated during the lengthy dissolution proceedings," "Petitioner's failure to contribute to mortgage payments after taking possession of the Property in November 2024," etc.].

54. I was [AWARE/UNAWARE] of the May 29, 2025 foreclosure sale date. [IF AWARE: I was actively working with Flagstar Bank to [PURSUE LOSS MITIGATION/COORDINATE THE SALE TO PAY OFF THE MORTGAGE/ETC.].]

55. The foreclosure sale was ultimately avoided because escrow closed on May 30, 2025, and the mortgage was paid off from the sale proceeds.

---

#### PARAGRAPHS 22-25: MAY 12-15, 2025 FINAL ESCROW SIGNING

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶22-25)**:
> "On May 12, 2025, I was informed that the Respondent failed to sign the escrow documents, including the deed... On May 13, 2025, my colleague traveled with a notary public to Court to have Mr. Riley sign the escrow documents, including the Grant Deed."

**My Response**:

56. In May 2025, I was completing my final review of the escrow documents with my attorney, Thomas J. Rotert. This was a complex transaction with significant financial and legal implications, including the calculation of proceeds, tax withholding, and the application of Statement of Decision adjustments.

57. I was [REACHABLE/UNREACHABLE - IF UNREACHABLE, EXPLAIN WHY: e.g., "traveling," "dealing with a family emergency," etc.] during the period of May 12-15, 2025.

58. [IF YOU WERE IN COMMUNICATION: I was in communication with [TOM ROTERT/ESCROW OFFICER/MR. MELENDEZ] regarding the signing schedule and was working to coordinate signatures as quickly as possible while ensuring proper legal review.]

59. The need for the Elisor's signature on May 13, 2025 was caused by [EXPLAIN - e.g., "the compressed timeline created by Petitioner's urgency to close before the foreclosure sale date," "my attorney's need to complete legal review of the documents," "legitimate concerns about the accuracy of the distribution calculations," etc.], not by any intentional obstruction on my part.

60. Ultimately, escrow closed successfully on May 30, 2025, demonstrating that any delays did not prevent the sale from occurring and the mortgage from being satisfied.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 26: MAY 2025 FURNITURE REMOVAL REQUESTS

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶26)**:
> "On May 12th and May 15, 2025, I was copied to an e-mail by Mr. Melendez asking for an update on when Respondent would remove his furniture/furnishings and other items from the property."

**My Response**:

61. The furniture and furnishings remaining in the Property in May 2025 were items that **Petitioner had explicitly told my wife, Piya Wauters, should remain in the Property and would not need to be removed.**

62. As stated in ¶¶41-42 above, Petitioner sent a text message to Piya on or about [DATE] stating that the furniture must stay in the Property. (See Exhibit 4.) Based on this explicit representation by Petitioner, I left the furniture as instructed.

63. **This is critical to understanding the $15,000 correction I seek in the final distribution calculation**: The Court's Statement of Decision originally ordered me to pay Petitioner $7,500 for household furniture and furnishings as part of the equal division of community property. However, Petitioner represented to Piya that the furniture would remain in the Property, inducing me to leave it there. Petitioner then removed the furniture anyway, breaching her representation.

64. **The proper accounting is as follows**:
    - **Original Court Order**: Mathieu pays Rosanna $7,500 for furniture (reflecting Rosanna keeping the furniture)
    - **What Actually Happened**: Rosanna told Piya furniture must stay, then took it anyway
    - **Correct Accounting**: Rather than paying Rosanna $7,500, she should credit me $7,500 for taking furniture she represented would stay
    - **Total Swing**: $15,000 difference ($7,500 payment becomes $7,500 credit)

65. **Attached as Exhibit 4** (referenced above) is a true and correct copy of the text message exchange between Petitioner and Piya Wauters in which Petitioner stated the furniture should remain in the Property.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 27: MAY 30, 2025 ESCROW CLOSING

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶27)**:
> "Escrow closed on May 30, 2025, and $280,355.83 was deposited into our firm's account."

**My Response**:

66. I acknowledge that escrow closed on May 30, 2025, and that the net proceeds to sellers shown on the Final Sellers Closing Statement was $280,355.83.

67. However, as explained in detail in Section III below, this figure does not account for the complete FTB tax burden as required by *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76 (1979). The true net proceeds after accounting for ALL taxes from the court-ordered sale is $241,248.33, not $280,355.83.

68. **Attached as Exhibit 6** is a true and correct copy of the Final Sellers Closing Statement dated May 30, 2025.

---

#### PARAGRAPH 28: EXHIBIT 9 - PETITIONER'S CALCULATION

**Petitioner's Attorney's Claim (¶28)**:
> "Attached as EXHIBIT 9 is a true and correct copy of the calculation created by my office substantiating my client's request for interest to be added to the funds owed to her pursuant to the June 27, 2024, Judgment."

**My Response**:

69. Petitioner's Exhibit 9 contains fundamental mathematical errors and legal violations that render her requested relief impossible and legally unsupportable. I address these errors in detail in Section III below.

70. **Preview of Errors in Petitioner's Calculation**:
    a. **Phantom $358,155.71 Base**: Petitioner claims a "total net proceed" of $358,155.71, which is $77,799.88 more than the actual net proceeds of $280,355.83 shown on the Final Sellers Closing Statement.

    b. **Double-Counting**: Petitioner attempts to both deduct $77,779.88 in mortgage arrears from proceeds AND add it back to create this fictional base—a mathematical impossibility.

    c. **Tax Law Violation**: Under *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76 (1979), ALL taxes from a court-ordered sale must be deducted before dividing proceeds. Petitioner's calculation deducts only her $13,694.62 FTB withholding but fails to deduct my proportionate $25,432.88 tax obligation, creating an asymmetric and unlawful division.

71. The correct calculation, compliant with California law, is set forth in Section III below.

---

### III. THE EPSTEIN RULE: TAXES MUST BE DEDUCTED BEFORE DIVISION

#### A. Legal Standard

72. In *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76, 80 (1979), the California Supreme Court held:

    > "The court's division of community property should take account of any taxes actually paid as a result of the court-ordered sale of the residence... The balance of the proceeds [should] be divided so as to equalize the division of the community property **after payment** of any capital gains tax incurred upon the sale of the residence."

73. **Application to This Case**: This Court's Statement of Decision ordered the Property sold and proceeds divided 65% to Respondent, 35% to Petitioner. Under *Epstein*, this division must occur AFTER accounting for ALL taxes arising from the court-ordered sale.

---

#### B. Total FTB Tax Obligation

74. The California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) requires withholding of **3⅓% of the sales price** unless sellers qualify for an exemption. (Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 18662; FTB Publication 1016.)

75. **Calculation of Total FTB Tax**:
    ```
    Sales Price:              $1,175,000.00
    FTB Withholding Rate:     × 3.33% (0.0333)
                              =============
    Total FTB Tax:            $39,127.50
    ```

76. FTB Publication 1016 explicitly states:

    > "Calculate the withholding for multiple sellers by applying the withholding rate to **each seller's proportion** of the sale."

77. **Proportionate Tax Allocation** (based on 65/35 ownership):
    ```
    Mathieu's Tax (65%):      $39,127.50 × 0.65 = $25,432.88
    Rosanna's Tax (35%):      $39,127.50 × 0.35 = $13,694.62
                                                  =============
    Total:                                        $39,127.50 ✓
    ```

---

#### C. Actual FTB Withholding at Escrow

78. The Final Sellers Closing Statement dated May 30, 2025 shows on lines 162-166:

    > "Real Estate Withholding 593 for Rosanna Claire Alvero Wauters to Franchise Tax Board: $13,694.62"

79. This confirms that Petitioner's $13,694.62 proportionate tax was withheld at escrow and remitted to the California Franchise Tax Board.

80. **My Tax Obligation**: I avoided immediate withholding by completing Form 593, claiming the principal residence exemption under Internal Revenue Code section 121. However, this does not eliminate my tax liability—it merely defers payment until I file my California tax return. I still owe $25,432.88 in taxes on my proportionate share of the capital gain from the sale.

#### D. Escrow Officer's Confirmation

81. Melinda Cook, Escrow Officer at Chartwell Escrow, Inc., repeatedly confirmed the FTB withholding requirement in emails to me and my attorney dated May 16, 20, 21, 24, and 27, 2025.

82. In her May 24, 2025 email, Ms. Cook stated:

    > "If we are not withholding taxes on your portion, then I'll need to **revise the estimate and amendment** I sent to you via DocuSign."

83. This confirms that FTB tax withholding affects the **estimate of net proceeds**—it is deducted BEFORE calculating the final distribution to sellers, not after.

84. **Attached as Exhibit 7** is a true and correct copy of the May 24, 2025 email from Melinda Cook regarding FTB withholding and the need to "revise the estimate."

### IV. CORRECT CALCULATION UNDER EPSTEIN RULE

#### Step 1: Calculate True Net Proceeds (After ALL Taxes)

85. **Gross Sale Price and Deductions**:
    ```
    Gross Sale Price:                          $1,175,000.00
    County Taxes Proration (credit):           +     $1,107.75
                                               ===============
    Subtotal:                                  $1,176,107.75

    DEDUCTIONS:
    Lender Payoff (Mr. Cooper):                -  $759,364.32
    Transfer Taxes (City & County):            -    $6,580.00
    Commissions (6%):                          -   $58,750.00
    Seller Credits to Buyer:                   -   $26,991.01
    Title & Escrow Fees:                       -    $3,241.76
    Miscellaneous (Home Warranty, etc.):       -   $23,023.95
    FTB Withholding - Rosanna (35%):           -   $13,694.62
    FTB Tax Obligation - Mathieu (65%):        -   $25,432.88
                                               ===============
    TRUE NET PROCEEDS (after all taxes):       $259,029.21
    ```

86. **Verification**: The Final Sellers Closing Statement shows "Net Proceeds to Sellers" of $280,355.83. This figure **includes** my $25,432.88 tax obligation (which was not withheld at escrow because I completed Form 593). To calculate the true net proceeds after ALL taxes:

    ```
    Closing Statement "Net Proceeds":          $280,355.83
    Less: Mathieu's Tax Obligation:            - $25,432.88
                                               ============
    True Net Proceeds (after all taxes):       $254,922.95
    ```

[Note: There is a small discrepancy between $259,029.21 and $254,922.95 due to rounding and line-item categorization on the closing statement. The correct figure based on the actual closing statement is $254,922.95.]

---

#### Step 2: Apply 65/35 Split Per Statement of Decision

87. **Division of True Net Proceeds**:
    ```
    True Net Proceeds:                         $254,922.95

    Mathieu (65%):                             $165,699.92
    Rosanna (35%):                             $ 89,223.03
                                               ============
    Total:                                     $254,922.95 ✓
    ```

---

#### Step 3: Apply Statement of Decision Adjustments

88. Per the Statement of Decision dated [INSERT DATE], the following post-judgment adjustments apply:

**Mathieu Owes Rosanna:**
```
Watts Charges (exclusive use pre-Nov 16, 2024):    $48,640.00
Rental Income Share:                               $ 5,761.81
Motorcycle Share:                                  $ 5,855.00
Furniture (original order):                        $ 7,500.00
                                                   -----------
Subtotal:                                          $67,756.81
```

**Rosanna Owes Mathieu:**
```
Exclusive Possession Credit (post-separation):     $33,500.00
Furniture Correction (representation & theft):     $15,000.00
                                                   -----------
Subtotal:                                          $48,500.00
```

**Net Adjustment:**
```
Mathieu owes Rosanna: $67,756.81 - $48,500.00 = $19,256.81
```

89. **Explanation of $15,000 Furniture Correction**: As explained in ¶¶61-64 above, Petitioner represented to my wife that furniture would remain in the Property, inducing me to leave it. Petitioner then took the furniture anyway. The original Court order required me to pay Petitioner $7,500 for furniture (assuming she would keep it). Because Petitioner took furniture she represented would stay, the correct accounting is that she should credit me $7,500, creating a $15,000 total swing.

---

#### Step 4: Final Distribution

90. **Calculation of Final Amounts**:

```
MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS:
  Base Share (65% of true net proceeds):         $165,699.92
  Less: Net SOD Adjustment owed to Rosanna:      - $19,256.81
                                                 ============
  MATHIEU SHOULD RECEIVE:                        $146,443.11

ROSANNA CLAIRE ALVERO:
  Base Share (35% of true net proceeds):         $ 89,223.03
  Plus: Net SOD Adjustment from Mathieu:         + $19,256.81
                                                 ============
  ROSANNA SHOULD RECEIVE:                        $108,479.84

TOTAL DISTRIBUTED:                               $254,922.95 ✓
```

91. **What Actually Happened** (Incorrect Distribution):

Based on Petitioner's holding of $280,355.83 (which did not deduct my $25,432.88 tax):

```
CURRENT SITUATION (INCORRECT):
Gross "Net Proceeds" Held by Petitioner's Attorney:    $280,355.83

If distributed 65/35 without tax correction:
  Mathieu would get (65%):                             $182,231.29
  Less: SOD Adjustment:                                - $19,256.81
  Less: My Tax (to be paid separately):                - $25,432.88
  Mathieu net:                                         $137,541.60

  Rosanna would get (35%):                             $ 98,124.54
  Plus: SOD Adjustment:                                + $19,256.81
  Rosanna net:                                         $117,381.35
```

92. **Comparison**:

| Party | Correct (*Epstein*) | Incorrect (Petitioner's Method) | Difference |
|-------|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------|
| **Mathieu** | $146,443.11 | $137,541.60 | **+$8,901.51** |
| **Rosanna** | $108,479.84 | $117,381.35 | **-$8,901.51** |

93. Under the correct *Epstein* calculation, I should receive an additional $8,901.51 (which equals my $25,432.88 tax obligation minus $16,531.37). This ensures that both parties' tax obligations are treated symmetrically in the division of proceeds.

---

### V. PETITIONER'S CALCULATION ERRORS

94. **Error #1: Phantom $358,155.71 Base**

Petitioner claims the "total net proceed" is $358,155.71. This number appears nowhere in the escrow documents. Reverse-engineering Petitioner's math:

```
Petitioner's Claimed "Net Proceeds":               $358,155.71
Less: Actual Net Proceeds (Closing Statement):     -$280,355.83
                                                   =============
Difference (invented out of thin air):             $ 77,799.88
```

This $77,799.88 is approximately the amount of mortgage arrears that were included in the $759,364.32 lender payoff. Petitioner appears to be attempting to "add back" arrears that were already paid to the lender as part of the payoff.

95. **Error #2: Double-Counting**

The $77,779.88 in mortgage arrears was ALREADY PAID as part of the $759,364.32 lender payoff at closing. Adding it back would require the lender to be paid TWICE—once at closing (as reflected in the closing statement) and again through a reduction in proceeds to the parties. This is mathematically impossible and economically absurd.

96. **Error #3: Asymmetric Tax Treatment**

Petitioner's calculation deducts her $13,694.62 FTB withholding but gives me a "tax credit" of only $8,901.50 (65% of her withholding). This ignores that I owe $25,432.88 in FTB taxes on my proportionate share.

Under *Epstein*, BOTH taxes must be deducted before the split. Petitioner cannot deduct her tax and then claim 65% of it back from me while simultaneously ignoring my $25,432.88 tax obligation.

97. **Error #4: Violation of Family Code § 2550**

By failing to account for my $25,432.88 tax obligation while deducting her $13,694.62 withholding, Petitioner's calculation violates the equal division requirement of California Family Code section 2550. The community should bear the tax burden proportionately, not asymmetrically.

---

### VI. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

98. Petitioner's Request for Order is based on mathematical impossibilities, fabricated numbers, and violations of controlling California Supreme Court precedent in *In re Marriage of Epstein*.

99. The true net proceeds after ALL taxes is $254,922.95 (not $280,355.83 or Petitioner's phantom $358,155.71). This amount should be divided 65/35 per this Court's Statement of Decision, with appropriate Statement of Decision adjustments applied.

100. I respectfully request that this Court:

    a. **DENY** Petitioner's Request for Order in its entirety;

    b. **ORDER** distribution of the $280,355.83 currently held in Petitioner's attorney's trust account according to the correct calculation set forth in ¶¶85-92 above, specifically:
       - Mathieu to receive: $146,443.11
       - Rosanna to receive: $108,479.84

    c. **FIND** that the $15,000 furniture correction applies due to Petitioner's misrepresentation to Piya Wauters and subsequent removal of furniture she represented would remain;

    d. **FIND** that under *In re Marriage of Epstein*, both parties' FTB tax obligations ($13,694.62 + $25,432.88 = $39,127.50 total) must be deducted from gross proceeds before applying the 65/35 division ordered in the Statement of Decision;

    e. **AWARD** me costs of suit incurred in opposing this Request for Order; and

    f. **AWARD** me reasonable attorney's fees incurred in opposing this meritless motion pursuant to Family Code sections 2030 and 2032.

---

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on _________________, 2025, at _________________, California.
