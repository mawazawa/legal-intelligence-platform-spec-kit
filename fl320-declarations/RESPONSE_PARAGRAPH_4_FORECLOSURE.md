# RESPONSE TO ¶4: FORECLOSURE TIMELINE MISREPRESENTATION

## PETITIONER'S CLAIM (¶4)

> "On June 11, 2024, I was informed by my client that the mortgage company will be sending letters regarding foreclosure due to the outstanding unpaid mortgage."

---

## PROBLEMS WITH THIS CLAIM

### 1. Vague and Misleading
- "I was informed by my client that the mortgage company **will be** sending letters"
- Not: "I received a foreclosure notice"
- Not: "The mortgage company notified us of foreclosure"
- Just: "My client told me they might send letters"

This is **hearsay** (attorney's statement of what client told her) about a **future possibility** ("will be sending").

### 2. Ignores Actual Timeline from Flagstar Bank

I personally called Flagstar Bank on **June 13, 2024** (2 days after Petitioner's attorney's claim) and was given completely different information.

## FLAGSTAR BANK TRANSCRIPT - JUNE 13, 2024

### Key Quote #1: No Sale Date, Plenty of Time

**Flagstar Agent (Alex)**:
> "Right now the home is in foreclosure as of the 11th. Uh, **so I want to make you aware of that. There's no cell date yet, so we got plenty of time.**"

**Me**: "When you say there is plenty of time, how much time do you mean?"

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "Well, it depends. **There's no cell days, like sometimes it takes a month to get it, too, just all depends.** But normally, like, if you start this review, that we can start today, **it suspends it, so the review takes 30 days, sometimes longer**, it just depends."

---

### Key Quote #2: Loss Mitigation Timeline

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "So as long as we tell you next time that your packet is complete, then the review will start then, and yes, **it should suspend the foreclosure.** Uh and then **it takes 30 days.** It just depends. It could be longer, less, it depends, but normally 30 days."

**Me**: "If today I start the review, so that gives me 30 days for the review, and then how many days after that do I have to then decide on the options?"

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "The review will start then, and the review, that's when **it's just suspended, and then it takes 30 days** off from there normally."

---

### Key Quote #3: At Least 60+ Days Before Any Foreclosure Risk

**Me**: "So the house is not at risk of foreclosure for in the next 60 days, let's say?"

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "Well, **whenever the packet is complete**, so it's still going to be active until we get all those documents and they tell you that the packet is complete, **only then they can possibly be suspended.**"

Translation:
1. Submit loss mitigation application (June 13)
2. Wait 5-7 days for completeness review
3. Once complete, foreclosure is SUSPENDED
4. Review takes 30 days minimum
5. Then 30 more days to decide on options
6. **Total: At least 60-90 days from June 13 = mid-August to mid-September 2024**

## FLAGSTAR BANK TRANSCRIPT - JUNE 27, 2024

### Key Quote #4: No Sale Date Established

**Flagstar Agent (Chris)**:
> "So let's see here. Okay, so there's **no sale date, so that's okay.**"

**Me**: "There's no sale date?"

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "Yeah, **there's no foreclosure sale date, so that's good.**"

---

### Key Quote #5: Foreclosure Process Just Started

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "So I think that they declared it to be an active foreclosure back on... Well, that was earlier this month. I think that they, uh, they were looking at still trying to do the modification and it didn't work, so they closed it down. So **I think that the date that they looked at the foreclosure began on June 11th.** Um, So, **in some ways, that's kind of somewhat relatively recent, that they just started the template**..."

---

### Key Quote #6: Best Possible Situation

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "But, I mean, if you're gonna look at it this way, man, **this is probably the best situation right now**, because if we were able to do it over the phone and just kind of start the review process, They're not gonna be holding a bank or, you know, unless they make a specific request to you for a document, you don't even have to start off with that. **So at least we're starting things now. And they should know something within, you know, roughly 30 days**, so, uh, **so this is kind of the best situation you could have**, given, you know, what's the situation at hand there?"

---

## FLAGSTAR BANK TRANSCRIPT - AUGUST 27, 2024

### Key Quote #7: Tentative Sale Date for END OF OCTOBER

**Me**: "I wanted to check on the status of the mortgage, and **I was told that there was a tentative foreclosure sale date for end of October 26th**, and I wanted to see if I could, because I just regain significant income, and I could, make the loan current and also resume payments."

**Flagstar Agent**:
> "Now, I do see where we talked to you on the 14th, um, and then you just talked to someone today. **We did need you to appeal this loss mitigation decision for a secondary review.**"

---

## TIMELINE SUMMARY

| Date | Event | Foreclosure Status |
|------|-------|-------------------|
| **June 11, 2024** | Foreclosure formally initiated | No sale date |
| **June 13, 2024** | I called Flagstar - Agent: "**plenty of time**" | No sale date |
| **June 27, 2024** | I called Flagstar again - Agent: "**no sale date, so that's good**" | No sale date |
| **August 27, 2024** | First mention of **tentative sale date: October 26** | **Tentative** sale Oct 26 |

## CORRECT STATEMENT FOR YOUR DECLARATION

### ¶[X]: RESPONSE TO FORECLOSURE CLAIMS

**In Response to ¶4 of Petitioner's Attorney's Declaration:**

4. Petitioner's attorney claims that on June 11, 2024, she "was informed by my client that the mortgage company will be sending letters regarding foreclosure." This vague, secondhand statement is misleading and omits critical context.

5. On **June 13, 2024** (two days after the date referenced by Petitioner's attorney), I personally called Flagstar Bank on a recorded line to inquire about the foreclosure status. The Flagstar collections agent, Alex, confirmed:

   > "Right now the home is in foreclosure as of the 11th... **There's no cell date yet, so we got plenty of time.**"

   When I asked how much time, Alex explained:

   > "There's no cell days... **But normally, like, if you start this review, that we can start today, it suspends it, so the review takes 30 days, sometimes longer.**"

6. I immediately applied for loss mitigation options (forbearance and loan modification) on June 13, 2024. Alex confirmed that this application would **suspend the foreclosure** during the 30-day review period, and I would have an additional 30 days to decide on options if approved.

7. On **June 27, 2024**, I called Flagstar again. Agent Chris confirmed: "**There's no foreclosure sale date, so that's good.**" Chris further explained that the foreclosure process had "**just started**" on June 11, 2024, and that my loss mitigation review was ongoing.

8. It was not until **August 27, 2024** (more than 2.5 months after Petitioner's attorney's claim) that Flagstar mentioned a **tentative** foreclosure sale date of October 26, 2024.

9. Petitioner's attorney's vague statement in ¶4 creates the false impression that foreclosure was imminent in June 2024, when in reality:
   - There was no sale date in June 2024
   - Flagstar agents described the situation as having "plenty of time"
   - I was actively pursuing loss mitigation options that would suspend foreclosure
   - The first tentative sale date was not set until 2.5 months later

10. **Attached as Exhibit [X]** are true and correct copies of the transcripts from my recorded phone calls with Flagstar Bank on June 13, 2024, June 27, 2024, and August 27, 2024.

## LEGAL ARGUMENT

Petitioner's attorney's ¶4 is a **vague, secondhand statement** designed to create a false sense of urgency and blame Respondent for foreclosure risk.

The **actual evidence** (recorded calls with Flagstar Bank) shows:
1. No sale date existed in June 2024
2. Flagstar agents assured me there was "plenty of time"
3. I immediately took action by applying for loss mitigation
4. The foreclosure was in its **earliest stages** in June 2024
5. The first tentative sale date was not set until **August 27, 2024** (October 26 sale date)

This contradicts Petitioner's narrative that Respondent was creating foreclosure risk through inaction.

---

## COUNTER-NARRATIVE

**Their Story**: "In June 2024, foreclosure was happening and Mathieu did nothing."

**Reality**:
- In June 2024, foreclosure process had just started with no sale date
- Flagstar said "plenty of time" and "no sale date, so that's good"
- I immediately applied for loss mitigation options
- First tentative sale date wasn't until August 27 (for October 26)
- I was actively working to resolve the situation through proper channels

---

**This demolishes their ¶4 claim.**

Use the highlighted quotes in your declaration, attach the transcripts as exhibits, and show the court that Petitioner's attorney's vague statement is contradicted by contemporaneous recorded evidence.
