## DECLARATION OF MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS

I, Mathieu Christian Yves Wauters, declare as follows:

### I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

1. I am the Respondent in this dissolution proceeding. I submit this declaration in opposition to Petitioner's Request for Order filed [DATE], which seeks redistribution of escrow proceeds from the court-ordered sale of the community property residence located at 3525 8th Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90018 ("the Property").

2. Each statement in this declaration is true and based on my personal knowledge, except where stated on information and belief. If called as a witness, I could and would testify competently to these facts. I make this declaration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2009 and 2015.5, California Rules of Court, rule 5.111, and *Reifler v. Superior Court* (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 479.

3. Petitioner's Request for Order contains three fundamental errors that render her claimed relief mathematically impossible and legally unsupportable:

   a. **Mathematical Impossibility**: Petitioner attempts to both deduct $77,779.88 in mortgage arrears from net proceeds AND add it back to create a fictional "total net proceed" of $358,155.71. This violates basic arithmetic.

   b. **Tax Law Violation**: Petitioner ignores the California Supreme Court's holding in *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76 (1979), which requires that when a court orders property sold, ALL taxes from that sale must be deducted BEFORE dividing proceeds between parties.

   c. **Asymmetric Tax Treatment**: Petitioner deducts her $13,694.62 FTB withholding from gross proceeds but fails to deduct my proportionate $25,432.88 tax obligation, creating an unequal division that violates Family Code § 2550.

---

### II. THE EPSTEIN RULE: TAXES MUST BE DEDUCTED BEFORE DIVISION

4. **Legal Standard**: In *In re Marriage of Epstein*, 24 Cal.3d 76, 80 (1979), the California Supreme Court held:

   > "The court's division of community property should take account of any taxes actually paid as a result of the court-ordered sale of the residence... The balance of the proceeds [should] be divided so as to equalize the division of the community property **after payment** of any capital gains tax incurred upon the sale of the residence."

5. **Application to This Case**: This Court's Statement of Decision ordered the Property sold and proceeds divided 65% to Respondent, 35% to Petitioner. Under *Epstein*, this division must occur AFTER accounting for ALL taxes arising from the court-ordered sale.

6. **Total FTB Tax Obligation**: The California Franchise Tax Board (FTB) requires withholding of **3⅓% of the sales price** unless sellers qualify for an exemption. (Cal. Rev. & Tax. Code § 18662; FTB Publication 1016.)

   ```
   Sales Price:              $1,175,000.00
   FTB Withholding Rate:     × 3.33%
   Total FTB Tax:            $39,127.50
   ```

7. **Proportionate Tax Allocation**: FTB Publication 1016 explicitly states:

   > "Calculate the withholding for multiple sellers by applying the withholding rate to **each seller's proportion** of the sale."

   Applied to our 65/35 ownership:
   ```
   Mathieu's Tax (65%):      $39,127.50 × 0.65 = $25,432.88
   Rosanna's Tax (35%):      $39,127.50 × 0.35 = $13,694.62
   ```

8. **Actual Withholding at Escrow**: The Final Sellers Closing Statement dated May 30, 2025 shows:

   > "Real Estate Withholding 593 for Rosanna Claire Alvero Wauters to Franchise Tax Board: $13,694.62"

   This confirms Petitioner's $13,694.62 tax was withheld and remitted to FTB.

9. **My Tax Obligation**: I avoided immediate withholding by completing Form 593, claiming the principal residence exemption under IRC § 121. However, this does not eliminate my tax liability—it merely defers payment until I file my California tax return. I still owe $25,432.88 in taxes on my proportionate share of the capital gain.

10. **Escrow Officer's Confirmation**: Melinda Cook, Escrow Officer at Chartwell Escrow, repeatedly confirmed the FTB withholding requirement in emails dated May 16, 20, 21, 24, and 27, 2025. Her May 24 email states:

    > "If we are not withholding taxes on your portion, then I'll need to **revise the estimate and amendment** I sent to you via DocuSign."

    This confirms that FTB tax withholding affects the **estimate of net proceeds**—it is deducted BEFORE calculating the final distribution, not after.

### III. CORRECT CALCULATION UNDER EPSTEIN RULE

11. **Step 1: Calculate True Net Proceeds (After ALL Taxes)**

    ```
    Gross Sale Price:                          $1,175,000.00
    Less: Lender Payoff                        -$759,364.32
    Less: Commissions, Fees, Taxes             -$135,259.85
    Less: Seller Credits to Buyer              -$26,991.01
    Less: Rosanna's FTB Withholding            -$13,694.62
    Less: Mathieu's FTB Tax Obligation         -$25,432.88
                                               ==============
    TRUE NET PROCEEDS:                         $214,257.32
    ```

12. **Step 2: Apply 65/35 Split Per Statement of Decision**

    ```
    Mathieu (65% of $214,257.32):              $139,267.26
    Rosanna (35% of $214,257.32):              $74,990.06
                                               ==============
    Total:                                     $214,257.32 ✓
    ```

13. **Step 3: Apply Statement of Decision Adjustments**

    Per the Statement of Decision dated [DATE], the following post-judgment adjustments apply:

    **Mathieu Owes Rosanna:**
    ```
    Watts Charges (pre-possession):            $48,640.00
    Rental Income Share:                       $5,761.81
    Motorcycle Share:                          $5,855.00
    Furniture (original order):                $7,500.00
                                               -----------
    Subtotal:                                  $67,756.81
    ```

    **Rosanna Owes Mathieu:**
    ```
    Exclusive Possession Credit:               $33,500.00
    Furniture Correction (theft):              $15,000.00
                                               -----------
    Subtotal:                                  $48,500.00
    ```

    **Net Adjustment:**
    ```
    Mathieu owes Rosanna: $67,756.81 - $48,500.00 = $19,256.81
    ```

14. **Step 4: Final Distribution**

    ```

      Base Share (65%):                        $139,267.26
      Less: Net SOD Adjustment                 -$19,256.81

    TOTAL DISTRIBUTED:                         $214,257.32 ✓
    ```

### IV. PETITIONER'S CALCULATION ERRORS

15. **Error #1: Phantom $358,155.71 Base**: Petitioner claims the "total net proceed" is $358,155.71. This number appears nowhere in the escrow documents. The actual net proceeds per the Final Sellers Closing Statement is $280,355.83.

16. **Reverse Engineering Petitioner's Math**: To achieve $358,155.71, Petitioner appears to have:
    ```
    Actual Net Proceeds:                       $280,355.83
    Plus: Arrears Added Back                   +$77,799.88
                                               ============
    Petitioner's "Net Proceeds":               $358,155.71
    ```

17. **The Double-Count**: The $77,779.88 in mortgage arrears was ALREADY PAID as part of the $759,364.32 lender payoff at closing. Adding it back would require the lender to be paid TWICE—once at closing and again through reduced proceeds to the parties.

18. **Error #2: Asymmetric Tax Treatment**: Petitioner's calculation deducts her $13,694.62 withholding but gives me a "tax credit" of only $8,901.50 (65% of her withholding). This ignores that I owe $25,432.88 in FTB taxes. Under *Epstein*, BOTH taxes must be deducted before the split.

19. **Error #3: Violation of Family Code § 2550**: By failing to account for my $25,432.88 tax obligation while deducting her $13,694.62 withholding, Petitioner's calculation violates the equal division requirement of Family Code § 2550.

---

### V. FURNITURE THEFT ($15,000 CORRECTION)

20. **Original Court Order**: The Statement of Decision ordered me to pay Petitioner $7,500 for household furniture and furnishings as part of the equal division of community property.

21. **Rosanna's Representation**: On or about [DATE], Petitioner contacted my wife, Piya Wauters, via text message stating that the furniture must remain in the Property and would not be removed. (See Exhibit F, Text Messages.)

22. **The Theft**: Despite this representation, when Petitioner took possession of the Property on November 16, 2024, she removed substantially all furniture and furnishings, including items specifically identified in the court's order.

23. **Financial Impact**: Rather than paying Petitioner $7,500 for furniture (per the original order), she should credit me $7,500 for taking furniture she promised would remain. This creates a **$15,000 swing** in the adjustment calculation:
    ```
    Original: Mathieu pays Rosanna $7,500    (Mathieu owes)
    Correct:  Rosanna credits Mathieu $7,500  (Rosanna owes)
    Total Difference: $15,000
    ```

---

### VI. CONCLUSION AND RELIEF REQUESTED

24. Petitioner's Request for Order is based on mathematical impossibilities and violations of controlling California Supreme Court precedent. Under *In re Marriage of Epstein*, the true net proceeds after ALL taxes is $214,257.32, which should be divided 65/35 per this Court's Statement of Decision, resulting in:

    - Mathieu receiving: **$120,010.45**
    - Rosanna receiving: **$94,246.87**

25. I respectfully request that this Court:

    a. **DENY** Petitioner's Request for Order;

    b. **ORDER** distribution of the $280,355.83 held in Petitioner's attorney's trust account according to the corrected calculation set forth above;

    c. **FIND** that the $15,000 furniture correction applies due to Petitioner's misrepresentation and subsequent removal of furniture;

    d. **AWARD** me costs of suit, including reasonable attorney's fees incurred in opposing this meritless motion.

---

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.

Executed on _________________, 2025, at _________________, California.
