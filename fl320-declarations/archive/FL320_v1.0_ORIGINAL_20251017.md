## DECLARATION OF MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS

I, Mathieu Christian Yves Wauters, declare as follows:

### 1. INTRODUCTION AND PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE

1. I am the Respondent in this action. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated herein and could competently testify thereto if called as a witness. This declaration is made in support of my opposition to Petitioner's Request for Order filed June 25, 2025, seeking redistribution of escrow proceeds from the sale of the real property located at 3525 8th Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90018 ("Property").

2. Petitioner's RFO contains fundamental mathematical errors that render her requested relief impossible and legally unsupportable. The core flaw is her attempt to both deduct $77,779.88 from the net proceeds AND add it back to create a fictional "total net proceed" of $358,155.71. This is mathematically impossible and demonstrates either a fundamental misunderstanding of basic arithmetic or an intentional attempt to mislead this Court.

### 2. TIMELINE OF EVENTS - PETITIONER'S POSSESSION CONTROL

3. **Critical Date: November 16, 2024** - Petitioner took exclusive possession of the Property on this date. This fact is admitted in her own declaration at paragraph 19: "On November 16, 2024, I took possession of the home."

4. **Legal Significance**: Once Petitioner took possession on November 16, 2024, she became responsible for all Property-related expenses, including mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Her claims for "Watts charges" and other expenses after this date are legally baseless.

5. **Mortgage Payment Responsibility**: Petitioner's claim that I failed to pay the mortgage "since December 2023" ignores the fact that she took possession in November 2024. Any mortgage payments due after November 16, 2024, were her responsibility, not mine.

### 3. MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY OF PETITIONER'S CALCULATIONS

6. **The $77,779.88 Double-Counting Error**: Petitioner's calculation is fundamentally flawed. She claims:
   - The mortgage company was paid $759,364.32 at closing
   - This included $77,779.88 in "unpaid mortgage/escrow" costs
   - She wants to "add back" this $77,779.88 to the net proceeds
   - **This is mathematically impossible** - you cannot both pay a debt and add it back to your share

7. **Correct Calculation**: The escrow proceeds of $280,355.83 already reflect the payment of all mortgage obligations, including the $77,779.88. To "add back" this amount would be double-counting and result in an inflated, fictional total.

8. **Petitioner's Requested Distribution**: She seeks 35% of $358,155.71 = $125,354.50, but this figure is based on the mathematically impossible "add back" of the $77,779.88.

### 4. WATTS CHARGES ANALYSIS - TIMELINE CUTOFF

9. **Watts Charges Cannot Extend Past Possession Date**: Petitioner claims Watts charges through November 16, 2024, but she took possession on that exact date. Watts charges are for exclusive use and possession - once she took possession, the charges should end.

10. **Petitioner's Own Timeline Contradiction**: Her declaration shows she took possession on November 16, 2024, yet she claims Watts charges through that date. This is logically impossible - she cannot both owe Watts charges for exclusive use AND have taken possession on the same date.

11. **Correct Watts Calculation**: Watts charges should end on November 15, 2024, the day before she took possession. Any claims for November 16, 2024, and beyond are invalid.

### 5. TAX WITHHOLDING ANALYSIS

12. **Proportional Responsibility**: Petitioner claims $13,694.62 in tax withholding and seeks my 65% share ($8,901.50). However, tax withholding is typically split proportionally based on ownership interests.

13. **Petitioner's Admission**: She states she will "take full responsibility" for the tax withholding but then seeks reimbursement. This is contradictory and unsupported by law.

### 6. ATTORNEY FEES SANCTIONS - NO EVIDENCE OF BAD FAITH

14. **No Evidence of "Willful Disregard"**: Petitioner seeks $40,000 in attorney fees as sanctions, claiming I "willfully disregarded" court orders. However, she provides no evidence of bad faith or intentional violation of orders.

15. **Exercise of Legal Rights**: My actions were consistent with exercising legal rights, not violating court orders. Disagreement with Petitioner's interpretation of orders does not constitute "willful disregard."

16. **Petitioner's Own Delays**: The record shows Petitioner caused significant delays in the Property sale process, yet she seeks sanctions against me for delays.

### 7. CLEANUP COSTS - INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE

17. **No Proof of Damage**: Petitioner claims $6,419 in cleanup costs and $2,470 in removal costs, but provides insufficient evidence of actual damage or the condition of the Property before and after my departure.

18. **Normal Wear and Tear**: The photos attached to her declaration appear to show normal wear and tear, not damage requiring $6,419 in repairs.

19. **Petitioner's Use of Property**: After taking possession on November 16, 2024, Petitioner used the Property for her own purposes. Any cleanup costs should be offset by her use and benefit.

### 8. COUNTER-CLAIMS AND OFFSETS

20. **Petitioner's Possession Period**: From November 16, 2024, to the sale date of May 30, 2025, Petitioner had exclusive possession of the Property. She should be responsible for all Property-related expenses during this period.

21. **Offset for Petitioner's Use**: Petitioner's use of the Property from November 16, 2024, to May 30, 2025, should offset any Watts charges she claims against me.

22. **Petitioner's Delays**: Petitioner's own actions caused delays in the Property sale process, including her refusal to cooperate with the realtor and her delays in signing necessary documents.

### 9. LEGAL ANALYSIS

23. **Family Code Section 2550**: The division of community property must be "equal" unless there is a valid reason for unequal division. Petitioner's requested division is not equal and lacks legal justification.

24. **Family Code Section 271**: Attorney fees sanctions require a showing of conduct that "frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation." My actions were consistent with exercising legal rights, not frustrating settlement.

25. **Watts Charges Law**: Watts charges are for exclusive use and possession. Once Petitioner took possession, the charges should end. Her claims for charges after possession are legally unsupportable.

### 10. REQUESTED RELIEF

26. **Denial of RFO**: I request that this Court deny Petitioner's Request for Order in its entirety due to the fundamental mathematical errors and legal deficiencies outlined above.

27. **Correct Distribution**: The escrow proceeds of $280,355.83 should be divided according to the Judgment: 65% to me ($182,231.29) and 35% to Petitioner ($98,124.54).

28. **Offset Claims**: I request that any Watts charges be calculated only through November 15, 2024, and that Petitioner's use of the Property from November 16, 2024, to May 30, 2025, be offset against any charges.

29. **Attorney Fees**: I request that this Court deny Petitioner's request for attorney fees sanctions and instead order her to pay my attorney fees for this unnecessary motion.

### 11. CONCLUSION

30. Petitioner's Request for Order is based on fundamental mathematical errors and legal misstatements. The core flaw - attempting to both deduct and add back the same $77,779.88 - renders her entire calculation invalid. Her claims for Watts charges after taking possession, attorney fees sanctions without evidence of bad faith, and cleanup costs without proof of damage are all legally unsupportable.

31. I respectfully request that this Court deny Petitioner's Request for Order and order the escrow proceeds divided according to the Judgment without the mathematical errors and legal deficiencies contained in Petitioner's motion.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
