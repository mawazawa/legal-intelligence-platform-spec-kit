## DECLARATION OF MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS

I, Mathieu Christian Yves Wauters, declare as follows:

### INTRODUCTION

1. I submit this updated declaration to ensure the Court has the full chronology of (a) the Franchise Tax Board withholding issue that Escrow Officer Melinda Cook raised in mid-May 2025, and (b) the Family Law Attorney Real Property Lien (FLARPL) recorded by Petitioner's counsel, Simon Law, that nearly derailed closing three days before the original May 16 target. Both issues go directly to the math behind the 65/35 distribution and were omitted from Petitioner's moving papers.

2. All statements are based on my personal knowledge or on communications with escrow and counsel. True and correct copies of the cited emails and documents are in the Evidence Explorer (see anchors).

### FRANCHISE TAX BOARD WITHHOLDING (FORM 593)

3. On May 16, 2025, Escrow Officer Melinda Cook told us that the Form 593 I had signed before a notary was incomplete and that she was legally required to withhold **3.33% of the $1,175,000 sale price**—$39,097.50—unless she received a fully completed exemption certification. She stated this plainly: “*We are required to withhold 3.33% of the sale price from sale proceeds unless we receive a completed 593 stating that the sale is exempt from withholding.*” (Cook email, May 16, 2025). The escrow team therefore treated the withholding as a **pre-distribution** obligation.

4. Melinda followed up on May 19–21 with an updated Form 593 that she completed herself, warning that—absent a corrected form from me—she would use that version and send the withholding check to the **California Franchise Tax Board (FTB)** at close. Her May 21 email says: “*Please note this is the version I will use and send to California FTB, along with the withholding check, at close of escrow unless I am in receipt of a corrected document from you ASAP.*”

5. When the transaction eventually closed on May 30, 2025, the **Seller’s Final Closing Statement** still showed a line item titled “Real Estate Withholding 593 … to Franchise Tax Board” in the amount of **$13,694.62**. This was the actual withholding calculated on Rosanna Alvero’s 35% share of the proceeds once escrow reconciled the net numbers. The withholding came *out of escrow before any “net proceeds” split.* The statement also shows an $22.50 “State Withholding Assistance” fee, confirming the support work performed. (See closing statement, pp. 1–2.)

6. Petitioner's math wrongly ignores this reality: when she “adds back” $77,779.88 in arrears and then applies 65/35 to a fictitious $358,155.71 “net,” she double counts funds that were actually paid to third parties—including the FTB—before any split. Escrow’s bookkeeping and the withholding match the Ledger Explorer figures we now present.

### SIMON LAW’S $60,000 FLARPL (LIEN) AND CLOSING DELAY

7. On May 13, 2025—three days before the initial May 16 close—Petitioner’s attorney Selam Gezahegn disclosed that she had recorded a **$60,000 Family Law Attorney’s Real Property Lien (FLARPL)** against Rosanna’s share and that escrow had already inserted that lien as a payout line item on the settlement statement. My attorney, Tom Rotert, discovered this when he reviewed the escrow packet: “*This lien of 60K is now part of the closing statement to be paid directly to the Simon Firm out of escrow rather than a matter to be addressed later.*” (Rotert email May 12/13.)

8. Tom objected immediately. He told escrow he would not allow me to sign a closing statement that siphoned $60,000 to Simon Law before calculating the 65/35 orders. As he explained to the brokers: the lien had been recorded when I was self-represented and was not properly served; paying it from escrow would destroy any ability to contest its validity or to perform the Court-ordered 65/35 split correctly.

9. Selam responded on May 13 asserting she had already signed a “release of the FLARPL with $0 demand.” But she also insisted all net proceeds still had to be wired to Simon Law’s trust account and accused us of “derail[ing] the sale.” This exchange, combined with the incomplete Form 593, pushed the closing work into the following two weeks. Escrow could not proceed until (a) the lien release letter and (b) the corrected withholding paperwork were in hand. The transaction ultimately closed on **May 30, 2025** once those items were resolved.

### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR THE 65/35 SPLIT

10. The withholding and the lien both show why Petitioner's arithmetic is wrong:

    a. **Withholding:** $13,694.62 left escrow for FTB before any “net” distribution. Petitioner's “add back the arrears” theory ignores this mandatory payment and effectively counts the same funds twice.

    b. **Lien threat:** Had Simon Law succeeded in diverting $60,000 from Rosanna’s share pre-split, the ledger would have been distorted in Petitioner’s favor by at least $21,000 (35% of 60,000) against me. The fact that they recorded the lien and had to be pressed to release it underscores why the ledger must follow the Court’s orders—not ad hoc takedowns by counsel.

11. Our updated Ledger Explorer ties the closing statement, the Form 593 withholding, and the SOD orders together. The “Live Update” column in this workspace incorporates both the FTB timeline and the lien correspondence so the Court can see exactly why the correct 65/35 split yields the figures we proposed.

### RELIEF REQUESTED

12. I ask the Court to adopt our corrected distribution, order Petitioner to account for the FTB withholding she already received credit for, and reject her attempt to retroactively “add back” arrears that escrow had already discharged. If the Court wants live testimony, I am prepared to appear and authenticate these communications.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct. Executed on August __, 2025, in Los Angeles, California.
