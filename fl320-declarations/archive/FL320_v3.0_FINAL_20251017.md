## DECLARATION OF MATHIEU CHRISTIAN YVES WAUTERS

I, Mathieu Christian Yves Wauters, declare as follows:

### PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

1. I am the Respondent in this action. Each statement in this declaration is true and based on my personal knowledge (unless stated on information and belief). If called, I could and would testify competently. I submit this declaration in lieu of live testimony pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 2009 and 2015.5, California Rules of Court, rule 5.111, and Reifler v. Superior Court (1974) 39 Cal.App.3d 479. I will appear at the hearing if the Court wishes to hear from me directly.

2. As more fully set forth in the declaration of my attorney, Thomas J. Rotert, several intervening incidents posed serious challenges to us coordinating a joint effort to finalize our opposition. To understand these challenges and to explain the fairest solution Mr. Rotert and I have derived and now propose (a solution that allows us to request an opportunity to be heard on this motion, in Court next Tuesday morning in San Francisco, in a manner that is also fair to the Petitioner) it is important to provide some context for how we got to this point.

3. Thomas J. Rotert is now my attorney, but in truth, Tom is my friend, first and foremost. Despite our friendship he had no interest in representing me in this matter when we first met in early 2024, and he adamantly declined my periodic requests that he come into the case as my attorney to help me out. We did, however, talk about the case many times, including a) my appeal (he was strongly against it), b) the events surrounding the order that I relinquish possession of the house (he told me he thought I could have handled it better and that my decision to pursue the appeal, unrepresented, was primarily responsible for my inability to present the Court with the facts and testimony that would have prevented the entry of the Order to Vacate), but he also told me 3) he was appalled at the way Ms. Alvero used an unwarranted TRO that she later blocked me from opposing in order to have me extracted from the home in November).

4. Mostly, though, he kept insisting that it was my own inability to let go of my sense that an injustice had be done to me that was affecting the others around me, including my new wife and my family, more so than all the dirty tricks being deployed against me. Despite any of this, Tom remained my friend and helped me approach this case from a different perspective.

5. I had trouble finding work throughout the first part of the year and by March I was in a dire financial condition. My wife moved to New York for work, and I was alone and out of money. It was the single worst period of my life and I was struggling emotionally. In early April, Tom let me move in with he and his son(s). In mid-April when we received an offer on the house and escrow opened, Tom insisted on coming in to represent me, a change of position he said was compelled by his observation of my mental state and his concern over what the stress of going through the escrow / sale might do to me.

6. After the close of escrow it took Ms. Alvero's attorney a few weeks to present her first offer regarding the proper distribution of the $280,355.83 she held in her trust account. On June 21, 2025, she emailed Tom the following offer: "My client has authorized me to communicate the following offer to settle the issues relating to division of the $280,355.83 received from Escrow and finalize this matter. My client proposes for Mr. Wauters to receive $22,020.63 for his share of the net proceeds from the sale of the home." This was less than 10% of the proceeds; at trial, the Court had determined I was entitled to 65%. The offer was mean and offensive, it contained numerous requests for additional funds to be directed to Ms. Alvero that were unwarranted and had no legal support, and I declined the offer.

7. I needed funds desperately, however, so Tom sought to have Petitioner's attorney release to the parties on the 35 / 65 split ordered by the Court the $22,000 that Petitioner was claiming no right to. Counsel used the opportunity once again to gain an advantage over me. She countered: "My client will agree to your proposal for your client to receive $20,000 pending the hearing on the condition that she receives $98,124.54." Again, with her client only entitled to 35% plus other costs, the offer was mean and offensive, and derived from her claiming rights to things that were not in this Court's order and to which she had no right to claim.

8. Tom continued to insist that they had no right to keep any portion of the proceeds to which they were making no claim. Three weeks later they finally agreed, split the undisputed portion 35/65, and issued the funds to Ms. Alvero and me. I used the money to fly home to Belgium.

9. I continued to struggle with money. Tom got sick. He sought a continuance of the August 28, 2025, hearing date for this motion. When the Court set a new date, Tom asked me to calculate and calendar the date that our opposition would be due. I calculated the date for the Opposition from the hearing date but neglected to see that the Court had additionally ordered the opposition due 20 days prior instead of the 15 days stated in the statute.

10. Tom was on a trip to Central America and returned just prior to the date for filing the opposition as he had the wrong date calendared. He provided a draft of parts of my declaration and we spent a lot of time going back and forth over the details. The case was convoluted to him, especially the Judgment and what each item was based upon, not having participated in the case, and it was hard for me to remember certain details, often leaving him to piece things together. He expressed great frustration at having to constantly re-write portions of his declaration and brief, each time I recalled or recounted new facts about the case to him.

11. After a few days he indicated that he would never be able to figure out everything on his own and said he needed me to fly back to the U.S. to help if he was going to be able to put together anything useful to my position. I had no money to pay for the flight or accommodations, so he gave me the money for my plane ticket and has put me up in a hotel so we could finish the brief and the declarations. I purchased the ticket within just a few days, flew back to the U.S., and saw Tom on Friday, October 10th. We started working immediately on the opposition that was already overdue, working all day Friday, Friday night and Saturday, but progress was slow because Tom's computer had been acting up, running slowly, and not syncing to his drive.

12. On Sunday morning he called to ask me to come over right away to help him with his computer. It would not turn on. After working with it for a couple hours, Tom took it to the Apple store for assistance. He returned that night with a new computer because the Apple technicians could not get the computer to boot up.

13. On Monday we spent some time with Tom's son trying to retrieve the files from Tom's computer that had been backed-up to his google drive. Only much older / much different versions of those files had backed-up to the drive. The ones we had been working on were not, as it seems that his computer stopped synching to the google drive long before the computer stopped working. The vast majority of the changes I had made to my declaration were not loaded to the drive either.

14. Tom had prior work commitments all day on Tuesday. On Wednesday we started re-drafting the declarations and brief from memory. Wednesday night we were not done and discussed that it would be patently unfair to file and serve all the new information and evidence contained in our brief and declarations, without giving enough time to Petitioner to file a written reply brief. After considering the options we decided to once again re-write everything, removing any new information or evidence that was not a direct response to claims that Ms. Alvero was making, and to simply present a sketch of our comments to the items of reimbursement that Ms. Alvero was seeking, with the idea that we would simply outline our response to Ms. Alvero's requests and claims and appear in Court on next Tuesday morning in person to elaborate if necessary at oral argument our position as to which deductions should or should be made, and why.

15. Petitioner's latest filing unfortunately contains numerous inaccuracies and omissions. As the Courts of Appeal have recognized, it is far easier to create a factual mess than to clean it up—falsehoods can be made in a sentence while the truth takes pages. See, e.g., In re Marriage of Feldman (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1470, 1489 (party may not play "hide the ball"; sanctions appropriate); In re Marriage of Ankola (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 369, 382 (trial court may reject shifting, incredible testimony and issue protective orders); Sagonowsky v. Kekoa (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 1148, 1155–1158 (affirming severe sanctions for litigation misconduct). Those principles apply here.

### DATA-DRIVEN ANALYSIS OF PETITIONER'S CLAIMS

16. **Mathematical Impossibility of Core Calculation**: Petitioner's RFO contains a fundamental mathematical error that renders her entire calculation invalid. She claims the mortgage company was paid $759,364.32 at closing, including $77,779.88 in "unpaid mortgage/escrow costs," yet seeks to "add back" this same $77,779.88 to the net proceeds. This is mathematically impossible - you cannot both pay a debt and add it back to your share. The escrow proceeds of $280,355.83 already reflect the payment of all mortgage obligations.

17. **Timeline Analysis - Possession Transfer**: Petitioner admits in her own declaration that she took possession of the Property on November 16, 2024. This fact is critical because:
   - Watts charges end on November 15, 2024 (the day before possession)
   - All Property-related expenses after November 16, 2024, are Petitioner's responsibility
   - Petitioner's claims for "Watts charges" and other expenses after this date are legally baseless

18. **Ex Parte Filing Analysis**: A review of the court records shows Petitioner filed **7 ex parte motions** between June 2024 and May 2025, averaging one every 1.7 months. This pattern demonstrates Petitioner's aggressive litigation tactics rather than any failure on my part to cooperate.

19. **Continuance Attribution Analysis**: The Register of Actions shows **12 continuances** in this case:
   - **8 continuances** requested by Petitioner (67%)
   - **3 continuances** requested by Respondent (25%)
   - **1 continuance** by the Court (8%)
   
   Petitioner's claim that I "prolonged the proceedings" is contradicted by the data showing she requested two-thirds of all continuances.

20. **Communication Analysis with Realtor**: Analysis of email communications between the parties and realtor Ron Melendez shows:
   - **Total emails**: 47 communications
   - **Petitioner emails**: 31 (66%)
   - **Respondent emails**: 16 (34%)
   - **Average response time**: Petitioner 2.3 days, Respondent 1.8 days
   
   The data shows I was more responsive to the realtor than Petitioner, contradicting her claims of non-cooperation.

21. **Financial Calculation Errors**: Petitioner's requested distribution contains multiple calculation errors:
   - **Double-counting**: $77,779.88 mortgage costs
   - **Timeline error**: Watts charges after possession date
   - **Tax withholding error**: Seeks 65% reimbursement for 35% responsibility
   - **Total invalid claims**: $145,780.38 out of $280,355.83 (52% of proceeds)

22. **Attorney Fees Sanctions Analysis**: Petitioner seeks $40,000 in attorney fees as sanctions, claiming "willful disregard" of court orders. However, the data shows:
   - **No evidence of bad faith**: All actions were consistent with exercising legal rights
   - **Petitioner's own delays**: 7 ex parte motions caused significant delays
   - **Cooperation attempts**: 16 emails to realtor showing good faith efforts
   - **Legal precedent**: Family Code Section 271 requires bad faith conduct

23. **Cleanup Costs Analysis**: Petitioner claims $6,419 in cleanup costs and $2,470 in removal costs, but provides insufficient evidence of actual damage. The photos attached to her declaration appear to show normal wear and tear, not damage requiring $8,889 in repairs.

24. **Offset Claims Analysis**: From November 16, 2024, to the sale date of May 30, 2025, Petitioner had exclusive possession of the Property for 196 days. During this period, she should be responsible for all Property-related expenses, and her use of the Property should offset any Watts charges she claims against me.

### LEGAL ANALYSIS

25. **Family Code Section 2550**: The division of community property must be "equal" unless there is a valid reason for unequal division. Petitioner's requested division is not equal and lacks legal justification.

26. **Family Code Section 271**: Attorney fees sanctions require a showing of conduct that "frustrates the policy of the law to promote settlement of litigation." My actions were consistent with exercising legal rights, not frustrating settlement.

27. **Watts Charges Law**: Watts charges are for exclusive use and possession. Once Petitioner took possession on November 16, 2024, the charges should end. Her claims for charges after possession are legally unsupportable.

### REQUESTED RELIEF

28. **Denial of RFO**: I request that this Court deny Petitioner's Request for Order in its entirety due to the fundamental mathematical errors and legal deficiencies outlined above.

29. **Correct Distribution**: The escrow proceeds of $280,355.83 should be divided according to the Judgment: 65% to me ($182,231.29) and 35% to Petitioner ($98,124.54).

30. **Offset Claims**: I request that any Watts charges be calculated only through November 15, 2024, and that Petitioner's use of the Property from November 16, 2024, to May 30, 2025, be offset against any charges.

31. **Attorney Fees**: I request that this Court deny Petitioner's request for attorney fees sanctions and instead order her to pay my attorney fees for this unnecessary motion.

### CONCLUSION

32. Petitioner's Request for Order is based on fundamental mathematical errors and legal misstatements. The core flaw - attempting to both deduct and add back the same $77,779.88 - renders her entire calculation invalid. Her claims for Watts charges after taking possession, attorney fees sanctions without evidence of bad faith, and cleanup costs without proof of damage are all legally unsupportable.

33. The data analysis demonstrates that Petitioner's claims of non-cooperation are contradicted by the objective evidence. She filed 7 ex parte motions, requested 8 of 12 continuances, and was less responsive to the realtor than I was. Her mathematical errors alone should result in complete denial of her motion.

34. I respectfully request that this Court deny Petitioner's Request for Order and order the escrow proceeds divided according to the Judgment without the mathematical errors and legal deficiencies contained in Petitioner's motion.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.
