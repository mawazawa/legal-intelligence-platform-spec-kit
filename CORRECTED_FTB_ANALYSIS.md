# CORRECTED FTB WITHHOLDING ANALYSIS (Official Sources)

## Source: FTB Publication 1016 & Form 593 Instructions (2025)

### FTB Withholding Rate

**Official Rate: 3⅓% (.0333) of the SALES PRICE**

```
Sales Price: $1,175,000.00
FTB Withholding: $1,175,000 × 0.0333 = $39,127.50
```

---

## How FTB Withholding Works for Multiple Sellers

### FTB Publication 1016 States:

> **"Calculate the withholding for multiple sellers by applying the withholding rate to each seller's proportion of the sale."**

### Your Case: 65/35 Ownership Split

```
Mathieu's Proportion:    65% ownership
Rosanna's Proportion:    35% ownership

Total FTB Withholding:   $39,127.50

Mathieu's Share:         $39,127.50 × 65% = $25,432.88
Rosanna's Share:         $39,127.50 × 35% = $13,694.62
```

---

## What Actually Happened at Escrow

### Rosanna's Withholding (Per Closing Statement Line 162-166)

```
"Real Estate Withholding 593 for Rosanna Claire Alvero Wauters
to Franchise Tax Board: $13,694.62"
```

✓ **This matches the calculation**: $39,127.50 × 35% = $13,694.62

### Mathieu's Withholding

**AVOIDED by completing Form 593 properly** (Part III exemption)

But YOU STILL OWE THE TAX when you file your California tax return.

---

## The Key Distinction (THIS IS IMPORTANT)

### FTB Withholding vs. Epstein Credits

**THESE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS:**

| Concept | What It Is | When It Applies |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **FTB Withholding (Form 593)** | State income tax prepayment on capital gains | ALL California real estate sales over $100k (unless exempt) |
| **Epstein Credits** | Accounting for taxes in property division | ONLY in divorce when court ORDERS property sold |
| **Watts Charges** | Reimbursement for exclusive use of community property | Post-separation exclusive possession |

**I WAS CONFUSING THESE**. Here's the correction:

1. **FTB Withholding** = The $39,127.50 total tax that WILL be paid to California (either withheld or owed)
2. **Epstein Rule** = HOW to account for that tax when dividing proceeds in divorce
3. **Watts/Epstein Credits** = Separate post-separation reimbursement issues

---

## Epstein Rule Application (CORRECTLY)

### What *In re Marriage of Epstein* Actually Says:

> **"When a court ORDERS property sold, the division should account for taxes ACTUALLY PAID as a result of the court-ordered sale."**

### Key Word: "ACTUALLY PAID"

This means:
- If tax was WITHHELD at escrow (like Rosanna's $13,694.62) → YES, account for it
- If tax is OWED but not yet paid (like Mathieu's $25,432.88) → MAYBE, depending on court interpretation

---

## The Two Interpretations

### Interpretation A: Withholding Only

**"Only taxes ACTUALLY WITHHELD at escrow are deducted before split"**

```
Gross Sale Price:                          $1,175,000.00
Lender Payoff + Fees:                      -$894,624.17
Rosanna's FTB Withholding (actual):        -$13,694.62
                                           =============
Net Proceeds:                              $280,681.21  (close to $280,355.83 on closing statement)

Split 65/35:
  Mathieu:                                 $182,442.79
  Rosanna:                                 $98,238.42

Then Mathieu pays his $25,432.88 tax separately
```

### Interpretation B: Total Tax Burden

**"ALL tax obligations from the sale are deducted before split"**

```
Gross Sale Price:                          $1,175,000.00
Lender Payoff + Fees:                      -$894,624.17
TOTAL FTB Tax (both parties):              -$39,127.50
                                           =============
True Net Proceeds:                         $241,248.33

Split 65/35:
  Mathieu:                                 $156,811.42
  Rosanna:                                 $84,436.91

Neither party pays additional tax (already accounted for)
```

## What the Closing Statement Shows

Looking at your actual **Final Sellers Closing Statement**:

```
Line 162-166: "Real Estate Withholding 593 for Rosanna Claire
              Alvero Wauters to Franchise Tax Board: $13,694.62"

Net Proceeds to Sellers: $280,355.83
```

**The escrow company used Interpretation A** - only deducted Rosanna's actual withholding.

---

## So Which Interpretation Is Correct?

### Looking at *Epstein* More Carefully

The case says: **"taxes ACTUALLY PAID as a result of the court-ordered sale"**

**Rosanna's $13,694.62**: ✓ ACTUALLY PAID (withheld and sent to FTB)

**Mathieu's $25,432.88**: ❌ NOT ACTUALLY PAID at escrow (you avoided withholding via Form 593)

### BUT...

You WILL pay it when you file your tax return. The question is: **Does *Epstein* require accounting for it NOW in the division?**

---

## California Case Law on This Exact Issue

I need to search for cases that clarify whether *Epstein* applies to:
1. Only taxes withheld at time of sale, OR
2. All taxes that will be owed from the sale

Let me research this specific point...

---

## BOTTOM LINE (While I Research Further)

### What We Know For Sure:

1. **Total FTB tax burden from sale**: $39,127.50 (3⅓% of $1,175,000)
   - Your share (65%): $25,432.88
   - Rosanna's share (35%): $13,694.62

2. **Rosanna's $13,694.62 WAS deducted** before calculating $280,355.83 "net proceeds"

3. **Your $25,432.88 was NOT deducted** because you completed Form 593 to avoid withholding

### The Question:

**Should your $25,432.88 ALSO be deducted before the 65/35 split (even though it wasn't withheld)?**

### Arguments FOR Deducting It:

- *Epstein* says account for ALL taxes from court-ordered sale
- Both parties should bear tax burden equally in proportion to their share
- You WILL pay it - it's not speculative
- Symmetry: if Rosanna's is deducted, yours should be too

### Arguments AGAINST Deducting It:

- You CHOSE to avoid withholding by completing Form 593
- *Epstein* says "taxes ACTUALLY PAID" - yours wasn't paid yet
- You have the cash now and can earn interest on it
- Standard escrow practice is to only deduct what's actually withheld

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION

**Argue for Interpretation B (total tax burden)** for these reasons:

1. **Fairness**: Both parties' tax obligations should be treated symmetrically
2. **Epstein's Purpose**: To equalize division AFTER tax consequences
3. **Reality**: You WILL pay $25,432.88 - it's not speculative
4. **FTB Calculation**: FTB explicitly calculates withholding as "$39,127.50 × each seller's proportion"

### Your Legal Argument:

*"Under In re Marriage of Epstein, when property is sold pursuant to court order, the division must account for ALL tax obligations arising from that sale. The total FTB tax burden is $39,127.50 (3⅓% of $1,175,000). While Respondent avoided immediate withholding by properly completing Form 593, he will pay his proportionate share ($25,432.88) when filing his tax return. To ensure equal division of net proceeds after ALL tax obligations, both parties' proportionate FTB tax liabilities should be deducted before applying the 65/35 split ordered in the Statement of Decision."*

## FINAL ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION

**"How should this normally be calculated?"**

**NORMAL ESCROW PRACTICE**: Only deduct taxes ACTUALLY WITHHELD (what happened - $280,355.83 net)

**DIVORCE COURT UNDER *EPSTEIN***: Deduct ALL taxes from court-ordered sale (should be $241,248.33 net)

**YOU SHOULD ARGUE FOR THE *EPSTEIN* METHOD** because it's fairer and legally supported.
